This page is here for me to test webmentions for my website. If you need a place to test webmentions yourself then feel free to send them here (although there's up to a 30 minute delay for them to appear on the site).	

Here are a bunch of webmentions for other pages in this section:

{{< html >}}

<div class="h-feed">
	<a class="p-author h-card u-url p-name" href="https://rowanmanning.com/">Rowan Manning</a>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="h-entry">
				<a href="./" class="u-url">#</a>
				<a href="/wmt/1/" class="u-like-of e-content">I like this page</a>
			</span>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="h-entry">
				<a href="./" class="u-url">#</a>
				<a href="/wmt/2/" class="u-in-reply-to e-content">I agree with this page</a>
			</span>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="h-entry">
				<a href="./" class="u-url">#</a>
				<a href="/wmt/3/" class="e-content">I just wanted to mention this page</a>
			</span>
		</li>
	</ul>
