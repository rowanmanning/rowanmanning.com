    Happy New Year! We rang in the new year down in Brighton where Emms had a little party. It was a fun time and their new house is lovely. We were going to swim on New Year's Day however it was too rough, we walked along the seafront in the rain instead.

  * I'll write a [yearnote](/tags/yearnote/) soon probably. Just over four years of weeknotes now; the most consistent thing I've ever done by a long way.

  * A caveat that generally I like my job _however_ I hate being back at work so very much, friends. I'd like a small commune where I get to grow vegetables and only write code when it suits me for fun, I don't know if I've got another 30+ years in me tbh. I'll get used to it again, I'm sure.

  * We did a rubbish escape-room-in-a-box. We couldn't work out the final clue so we cheated by looking at a hint. We still don't understand it and neither do most of the reviewers online.

  * The plans have not slowed for January, it's looking like a busy one! We went to Fairgame in Canary Wharf and it was a lot of fun - fairground games with a leaderboard and stats, sign me up.

  * I turn 37 in a few weeks. Uncharacteristically I might fancy doing something, maybe a pub crawl?
