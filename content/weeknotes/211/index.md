  * What the fuck, America? Guess I need another news break.

  * Let's try and focus on the nice boring things happening in my life instead? Like on Monday I helped swap the direction a fridge opened. We made the lads a large fort with the boxes and they played in it all week.

  * Work was fairly smooth over the election coverage _except_ we found out that there's been a bug in our barrier pages for ~1.5 years and we've been intermittently not giving Google our content :+1: Alex and I spent nearly 3 days on it; I'm very grateful he was there

  * Saturday was wholesome. We made food, played a board game, hung out with the cats, and generally had a nice chilled day.

    On Sunday we went to Brighton, hung out with Charlotte's brother, and then went to see Jane McDonald. She was excellent :clap: the Cher medley was the highlight for me.

  * I need to get a handle on how much Factorio I'm playing. My god it's a good game but _such_ a time sink. I have shit to get done.
