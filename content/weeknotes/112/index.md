  * The sickness continued through the whole week. I'm feeling more normal now but still producing a worrying amount of snot. I'm still a bit worn down and weak and not sure if I can be bothered to trek into the office.

  * This weekend I managed to cut the shelves that have been sitting in our living room down to size. I've been putting it off because it's been ages since I did anything like this, which made it annoying how smooth and easy it was. We took them around to Euan and Gallal's to use their jigsaw (and more ventilated space). I just need to wait for some more sociable hours to drill holes.

  * We tried a drink that we saw on TikTok. You top up a bottle of Corona with Amaretto and it tastes very much like Dr Pepper. It's delicious, but also very deadly, especially after eating only a few slices of toast and recovering from illness.

    It snowed! I dragged myself out of my sick bed for a 10-minute walk to Wapping Woods while it was still falling. It was magical, I can't remember having this much snow settle in London. We met a very friendly chap who decided to chill with us for a while.

  * Sickness is good for catching up on TV. We watched all of Too Hot to Handle (same old cringe) and Wednesday (very Tim Burton).
