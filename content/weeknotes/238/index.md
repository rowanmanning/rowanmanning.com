    Our trip to Rome was lovely but actually a little too short. Rome's beautiful and we had perfect weather. I didn't think it was possible to eat too much spaghetti carbonara but, it turns out, it is.

    We crammed a lot of sight-seeing in: we had a look at Vatican City, The Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, the Colosseum. Actually name an old Roman building and we probably had a little look. I'd happily go back for a longer visit another time.

  * The more world cities I visit, the more I'm convinced that reviews like "It's very busy / dirty / sketchy" are written by people who have never left their small village in the countryside and send panicked messages to the residents Facebook group when they spot a youth they don't recognise.

  * Apart from Rome I didn't do much during the rest of my week off, which was delightful. I just lounged around and played video games - I finished the main story for Red Dead Redemption II (excellent) and now playing through the epilogue.

  * On Saturday we did the [Race Across the World experience](https://raceacrosstheworldexperience.com/) in London and it was so slick. Easily in my top three scavenger hunts, challenging enough but everything made sense and was doable without hints. It also takes you through some interesting bits of London (side streets, small parks etc) that I otherwise wouldn't visit.

  * We went to a Eurovision party, I wasn't really feeling it due to one country's continued involvement and I think I might be done with it now - time to boycott. It's a real shame but it feels hypocritical of me to support it while dutifully checking the origin of my avocados, you know?
