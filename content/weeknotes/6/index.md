  * We started making a Christmas cake! Yes I know it's a bit late, but really it already smells delicious. Also when you feed a Christmas cake it's wrong not to have a little bit of the brandy.

  * I released a [beta of Audrey](https://github.com/rowanmanning/audrey#readme), which is the first _useful_ side project I've worked on in many years. It's a feed reader and I'm really proud of it. What's a feed reader, I hear some of you ask? Well I also wrote a little blog post which explains: [I like RSS](/posts/i-like-rss/). I built Audrey to encourage me to read more, and it's working.

  * I'm trying to do [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) this year, it's a daily code challenge leading up to Christmas. I've managed [six days so far](https://github.com/rowanmanning/adventofcode-2020) and it's a nice way to kick my brain into gear in the morning. Some of the puzzles are a joy, some are horrible and probably far easier to solve if you have a Computer Science background. I just go ahead and nest 3 loops.

    It's definitely Christmas when you put up a tree. Ours is really really pointy; the point is like a good third of the tree. We couldn't find the coloured lights I bought last year so there's a more muted gold/green theme going on. We listened to Christmas songs, which masked the cursing from many pricked fingers.

  * I said I was reading more, here are some good things I read this week:
  
    * [Making Moves: How These Black Women Made The Switch from Junior to Senior Engineer](https://peopleofcolorintech.com/front/making-moves-how-these-black-woman-made-the-switch-from-junior-to-senior-engineer/) - thanks Keran and Jennifer for the POCIT recommendation.

    * [Meet The Black Women Trying to Fix AI](https://peopleofcolorintech.com/articles/meet-the-black-women-trying-to-fix-ai/) - good overview with lots of further reading. I read this just before finding out that [Google fired Timnit Gebru](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/04/timnit-gebru-google-ai-fired-diversity-ethics), which is _infuriating_.

    * [Engine Room 2020: going virtual](https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/engine-room-2020-going-virtual-7d4f77bc2969) - Sarah writes about running our internal tech conference fully remote for the first time. The conference itself was amazing this year and there are some good tips in this post.

  * I didn't watch a single Christmas film this week, maybe I overdid it in late November :thinking_face:

  * Next week is my last week at work before I'm off for Christmas. I didn't intend on saving so many holiday days, but it's just how this year worked out. I'm feeling a bit of last week panic, mostly because I still have 12 peer reviews to write as well as making sure the more important things on my to-do list are ticked off. I need to get better at dropping things that aren't important.

  * I wrote "Christmas" 10 times in this weeknote. Goodbye :wave: I'm going for a walk.
