  * I completed Astro Bot which is _maybe_ the best platformer I've ever played, I can understand why it got such great reviews. Every level introduces _something_ unique and it's really fun and charming, I'll almost definitely play through it again and it's nice to see new levels still being added. I'm not quite at 100%, few more things to collect and I actually will because this game is a delight.

  * Arjun and I did an impromptu j√§gerbomb crawl on Thursday which was quite nice. An old colleague used to swear that a j√§gerbomb at the end of the night cancels out a hangover. It's not true, folks, he was just 20 years old. Despite it not being true I had the kind of hangover on Friday where I'm somehow really productive, _possibly_ just a lot of residual redbull in my system.

  * On Friday evening we went to Six by Nico and had six courses of murder-mystery-themed food. It was good, however a large plate of chips would have probably suited me better. The wine pairing did help though!

  * Smashing it at work at the moment lxds, having a good time with several different projects at once and being very productive

  * Also being more active with Unite, seeing increased membership and we have an outside-of-work communication channel now üëç I think we have it on semi-easy-mode because Unite is already recognised and the business has a productive relationship with the {{< abbr title="National Union of Journalists" >}}NUJ{{< /abbr >}} already. Maybe I'll become a rep?

  * We got tickets for Pitbull, Mr. Worldwide himself, at the O2 üòé buying a bald cap
