  * I really enjoyed Christmas, we woke up late and spent most of the day cooking. We had a spreadsheet for all the meal timings which was very helpful, and I wasn't even the one to instigate it. We spent the evening on a bunch of different video calls with friends and family, and I ate and drank too much which is exactly how I intended on spending my day.

  * We tried our Christmas cake. It tastes like actual Christmas Cake and is delicious! I'm good at anything that involves beating egg whites so of course the royal icing is _perfect_.

  * On boxing day we ordered a pizza and ate it in bed.

  * Normally for Christmas and birthdays Charlotte and I buy each other gifts that are an activity we can go and do, or a trip somewhere nice. This year we decided to give each other _physical_ gifts. Charlotte got me a chef's knife which is _amazing_, I've wanted good knives for ages and I spent part of the day slicing food items into ridiculously small cubes.

  * I binge-watched all of The Queen's Gambit, which was really good. I'm impressed that they managed to have me on the edge of my seat for a chess montage, good work.

  * Charlotte downloaded Two Point Hospital in the Steam sale and we built a hospital together. It was a very nostalgic experience, there so many nice nods to Theme Hospital which I spent far too many hours on as a kid.

  * This is my last weeknote of 2020, what a year! :grimacing: here's hoping that 2021 is less exhausting, I'm not going to hold my breath though.
