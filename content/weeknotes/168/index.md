  * We watched Saltburn, loved it. Everyone in it was excellent. I'll never look at a bath in the same way. It's been a little while since I've been to the cinema and I'm not sure why, [Genesis](https://www.genesiscinema.co.uk/) is amazing and a very short walk away.

  * We got the PSVR out for an evening with some friends and we haven't put it away. We've been playing a lot of Beat Saber and can handle a few songs on Hard difficulty now. I forgot how fun VR is and how easy it is to forget you're kind of exercising a bit. My inner elbows and wrists ache.

  * We tried to go to a bubble experience all the way out in Wembley but they had a power cut and we didn't see the email before arriving. So we wandered around Wembley a bit, bought some sale stuff, and went home via Bleecker. It was a nice day despite the distinct lack of bubbles.

  * I'm not drinking for January and it's quite easy. I originally thought I'd still try and pub after work but it's cold and miserable so I haven't bothered. Why pub when you can go home and play VR or Cities Skylines?
