  * I got a new phone. It's purple, fast, and lasts for a whole day of use. I used to be the guy who got a new iPhone every time they launched and I'm quite pleased to be out of that phase, I had my previous one for _years_ before upgrading.

  * Some potentially big news: I think maybe I have ADHD. Although I haven't written about it before, it's something I've been vaguely exploring for a while. I'm bad at time management, focusing on tasks I'm uninterested in, and a shitshow when it comes to coping with stress (inwardly at least). I zone in and out of conversations far too easily (sorry), and I feel restless if my brain isn't doing something.

    On the flip side, when I'm interested in a task I can _really_ hyperfocus. I think maybe turning the hobby I was fixating on in my late teens (programming) into a job probably helped me not identify this for a long time because I've always been good at focusing on interesting programming problems.

    I'm trying to work out whether I should talk to a medical professional rather than just label myself based on doing a bunch of online tests. Though I'm told this is enough for some. I'm kind of fine, but taking a step back and analysing my behaviour has made me think about whether I can (and should) do something to adjust the aspects that make my life more difficult.

  * Charlotte and I went to see some comedy at [Backyard Comedy Club](https://backyardcomedyclub.co.uk/) because it's just down the road. It was cheap and fun! New act nights are always a bit mixed, but I'd go again.

  * Friday at work was Engine Room, the FT's annual internal tech conference. It was _such_ a good day, and always serves to remind me that I work with a lovely and talented bunch of people. Hopefully someone blogs about it publicly so I can share.

  * After Engine Room we went out for drinks which were particularly special because [Keran](https://github.com/ker-an) was back in London from Canada. So great to see her again, and it's always fun when someone senior puts a card behind the bar :eyes:

  * On Saturday Charlotte and I got the train up to York to spend a long weekend somewhere else. It's a really beautiful city, I liked it a lot. We didn't really gather up a lot of recommendations or make a plan but that made it feel quite chill.

    * We did a lot of walking around. We got a bus down to Riccall and walked the [Solar System Trail](https://astrocampus.york.ac.uk/cycle-the-solar-system/) in reverse. The planets are pretty far apart. We got rained on a bit, dried off at our Airbnb, and then went for a near-perfect Sunday roast.

    * We also walked around the city walls, did a bit of drinking and shopping, and ate a bit too much.
