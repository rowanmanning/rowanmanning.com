  * Happy New Year! I've been so exhausted since I stopped for Christmas, that hasn't changed – my sleeping pattern is really broken and I am _not_ looking forward to being ready to work at 9am tomorrow. We've been absolute bed-ridden slugs.

  * We rang in the new year with an excellent pub crawl via 10 different pubs in Whitechapel and Bethnal Green. There were five of us in total, which is about the right amount to keep everyone moving. It's probably the last time I'll drink for a while because&hellip;

  * I'm kicking off the new year with an elimination diet. I'm still trying to get to the bottom of my psoriasis flareups and occasional IBS-like gut issues (TMI). It's time I put on my big boy pants and make some sacrifices to find out some stuff about my body. So for the next three weeks (pray for me) I will not be consuming: alcohol, alliums (garlic, leeks, onions), corn, dairy (milk, cheese), eggs, some fruit (apples, citrus, melon, pears, stone fruit), gluten, legumes (beans, lentils, peanuts, peas), nightshades (aubergines, chilli, peppers, potatoes, tomatoes), nuts, oils (that aren't olive oil), red meat, seeds, shellfish, and soy.

    My birthday (26th Jan) will be the first day when I can start reintroducing things one at a time, and I'll be back on everything by early March. I'm going to be such a bore talking about all the food I miss, sorry.

  * We went for a nice long walk from Margate to Ramsgate via Broadstairs. Quite a pretty bit of coast and it was _super_ cold, like far colder than it's been all year. I enjoyed wrapping up.
