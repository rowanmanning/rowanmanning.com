  * I went to play Rounders with the Product & Tech department at the Financial Times. It was lovely, it's been _so_ long since I've seen many of my colleagues in person. I also got to meet some of the people who have joined since Lockdown began (they're all just as nice in person as online), and I met Anna's baby, she's very cute.

    We always have amazing weather for Rounders, this week has been beautiful if a little melty. We've been giving Toots a cold wet flannel, and he seems to enjoy it.

  * I had my mid-year review finally, it seems I'm doing well at my job but it is fairly clear that I'm burning out. I got great feedback on the last promotion round which makes me feel more chill about working on this one.

    I need to stretch my technical muscles more too â€“ I have a tendency to pick up any people issues or reactive work that crops up, and I have a lot to offer on the more technical side of my role. Generally positive but with some useful stuff to work on is an ideal feedback round :thumbs_up:

    I went on a stag do! We spent most of the weekend in an Airbnb playing board games with some light drinking, which was exactly my speed and didn't feel COVID-unsafe. We also cooked a bit and didn't spend a ridiculous amount of money, which was great.

    The best new game I played was [Fury of Dracula](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181279/fury-dracula-thirdfourth-edition), it's a really fun co-op game with one player taking the role of Dracula and trying to win by beating all of the hunters.

    The only stag-like thing we did was going to a shooting and archery place. It turns out that shooting guns is not only more fun than I expected, but I'm weirdly good at it and got the highest score on each range.
