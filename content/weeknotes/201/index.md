  * We're having a very flat and lazy week. Lots of bed, lots of boredom, lack of motivation. Maybe we're just tired and ill? Maybe we have a carbon monoxide leak? I should check the batteries in the alarm.

  * On Tuesday I had in-person boardgames for the first time in ages, got some exciting news from Scott, ate burgers and drank rum :+1:

  * On Wednesday Charlotte's mum came round for dinner and to hang out with us and the lads, it was nice and chilled.

  * On Friday I had the day off work to go to my cousin's wedding. I had such a nice time, caught up with a lot of extended family in a deeper way than I have in ages – I think it helped that there was a bouncy castle to distract all the kids. I got home super late because Rebecca lost her phone and we had to backtrack a lot.

  * It's quite possible I'm just doing too much at the moment.

  * I started [Dune Messiah](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44492285-dune-messiah), but part of my motivational struggle is reading.

  * I did a spreadsheet of our car hire and train costs over the last four years to see if it's worth buying a second hand car instead of hiring them all the time. Without data from Charlotte's bookings we're at £5,229 so far :sweat_smile:

  * Look at this little asshole.
