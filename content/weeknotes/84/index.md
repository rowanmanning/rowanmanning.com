  * We escaped all the bootlicking in London and flew to Turkey for a week with a few friends. We're staying in an all-inclusive (my first time) and I'm a big fan.

  * I'm eating and drinking too much. I'm trying to balance this with a lot of swims in the sea and pool.
  
  * The various shows they put on for entertainment are very cringe.

  * We walked ~10km in 26° heat to a waterfall nearby, it was pretty.

  * We tried the late-night "club" in the resort. It was just four of us and a polish couple for the full two hours it was open.

  * I've heard despacito many many times and think I know the pool playlist now (mostly beachy or reggae covers).

  * I wear shorts and linen shirts now, it's my summer look.
