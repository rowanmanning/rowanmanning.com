  * Merry Christmas!

  * My pre-Christmas treat to myself was going to see Spider-Man: No Way Home (#nospoilers). It's no secret that I'll just watch anything Marvel chucks out, but I think I agree that this is one of their best films, I loved it. I've been to the [Genesis Cinema](https://genesiscinema.co.uk/) a couple of times now, it's so cheap and infinitely better than some of the bigger cinemas.

  * I got my booster :tada: no queuing and super-efficient, and I had a nice chat about Java with the doctor who injected me.

  * We've still (according to all the tests we've done) not had COVID, against all the odds. The numbers are _wild_, stay safe everyone.

  * Charlotte's mum stayed for Christmas, we chatted to everyone else over video call because a stupid number of people we know have COVID now.

  * Christmas dinner was excellent, as usual. I love cooking it and, of course, we broke out the [festive spreadsheet](/weeknotes/9/) again.

  * Minecraft is just the best game, isn't it? Especially with friends, I love popping on the server and exploring the new buildings that have cropped up.

  * Anyway have a lovely new year :wave: hopefully 2022 is less of a shitstorm eh?
