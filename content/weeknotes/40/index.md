  * I'm fully vaccinated! I got my second shot of Pfizer on Monday with no side effects. St Thomas' was super efficient again, I was jabbed within 3 minutes of arriving.

  * I had one of the best work weeks I've had for years. [Gallal](https://twitter.com/gallal_sharaf) and I spent most of the week pairing on an experiment looking into server-driven UI. A lot of this was defining a schema for potential new API responses and it's right up my street.

    On Wednesday we both went into the office and I can't remember the last time I felt this useful and productive. We decided to treat ourselves to a little pint in The Sea Horse after work to escape the torrential rain.

  * I added a [Notes section](/notes/) to this site, I'm unsure if it'll stick around but I'm experimenting with putting things like likes/bookmarks/reposts on this website. It allows me to send webmentions with different types (e.g. "like"). The next step is to see if I can automatically syndicate these to Twitter.

  * I'm in Edinburgh! I really needed a break and I already feel a lot more relaxed, we'll be here for a few days over the weekend and then out near Loch Lomond for the rest of the week.

    I've had a lot of good whisky and food. We haven't really done much other touristy stuff yet except visiting [Camera Obscura](https://www.camera-obscura.co.uk/) while it rained heavily outside. By next week I'll hopefully have got a lot of good hiking in.
    
    Bye :wave: here's us on a thermographic camera.
