  * Failing at not doom-scrolling and watching horrible videos.

  * In a blatant attempt to get us back to the office, my employer made our canteen free for March and April.

  * In unrelated news, I've been in the office 2.5 days this week.

  * Charlotte found an AI-based horoscope app ([Co – Star](https://www.costarastrology.com/)) which we've both installed. It's utterly ridiculous, but also I kind of love the daily Do/Don't list. Today:

    * **Do:** Learning curve, WikiHow, and Books on tape.

    * **Don't:** Espionage, Message in a bottle, Butt text.
  
    Did anyone else have to read that last one twice?

    There's also a feature where you can chat to people with the same signs as you which is just an infinite pool of quite depressing content.

  * We went to see Jennifer and Chris for some gentle wine drinking. It was very nice, Riley decided to snuggle up on my chest which I needed. Riley is a cat btw.

  * We finished watching [One of Us Is Lying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_of_Us_Is_Lying_(TV_series)), I think it slightly tailed off for me towards the end and maybe we should have just binged it all in one.

  * We a couple of episodes away from finishing [Cheaters](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0b7pwbp) which I'm enjoying quite a lot. Big fan of the 10-minute episodes. I think it handles some tough relationship topics pretty well and it's also funny.

  * I'm down to 93 Dependabot PRs [from 500](/weeknotes/70/) on my various open-source projects. I think the last leg is gonna be tough, I'm hitting a few nasty major version bumps.

  * On Saturday we went to Charlotte's brother's girlfriend's 30th. It's our first proper time going to a thing where we had to chat to proper strangers, I think I did pretty well after some initial awkward small talk. We went to the karaoke after and got home at 5 am :grimacing:

  * I visited my grandma for the first time in ages and had a lovely time catching up. She's doing quite well now that it's been a full year [since my grandad died](/weeknotes/13/), and she's planning a trip to Yorkshire with my mum – something she just couldn't do with my grandad's mobility issues and care needs. I introduced her to Wordle (she loves word games and somehow hadn't heard of it).

  * I got [The Letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Letter_(Box_Tops_song)) stuck in my head somehow and made a playlist based around it which I've been listening to non-stop.

    {{< playlist "2QIibS6ZNXYlyNPBWMnHV4" "Give me a Ticket - a playlist on Spotify" >}}

    (Yeah I know I haven't had the mental energy to find an alternative to Spotify yet after all the Joe Rogan and Not Paying Artists stuff. I will get to it soon)
