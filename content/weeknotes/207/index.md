  * Euan's back in the country for a couple of weeks so we've been extra social. We went for curry on one evening and then drinks on another, nice to have him back for a bit. I'm very tired, these weeknotes won't be detailed.

  * [It's a Wonderful World](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/271324/its-a-wonderful-world) is a really nice board game, we tried it out this week and I'm a fan. Quite a few nice mechanics and fairly easy to grasp, also with four rounds it was really fast.

    It was mum's birthday this week. Over the weekend I took her and my sister to Mallow (my sister is vegan and my mum is _mostly_). Once again the tasting menu was excellent, however it's _just too much food_. I need to remember this for next time and just order from the regular menu.

  * We had cocktails again at J&C's, mostly focused on Whisky-based ones. Riley (cat) was very friendly and chill.

  * Charlotte's wanted me to play The Witcher 3 for ages so she can watch. I've been avoiding it because it seems like an awful lot of game to commit to. Cut to a few hours after starting and we're doing all the side missions :joy: it's quite fun, though I still doubt that I have the energy for this level of depth. There are so many systems and upgrades and modifiers and things to keep track of :zzz:

  * It's been getting colder and so our two lads are especially cuddly. They want to be on top of us all the time and I'm not anti this at all.

  * This week I started The Rings of Power, I ignored it until now because of poor reviews (did I read them online or did someone I know not rate it?). I'm actually really enjoying it, enough that I finished season 1 in about two days and am having to ration season 2. I need to remember that my bar for fantasy is probably lower than some people and I'll enjoy most things at least a bit.
