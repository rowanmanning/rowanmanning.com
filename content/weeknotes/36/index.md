  * We got contact traced. We saw a friend after work and they got a positive test result the next day, which means we have to isolate for 10 days. We had a big shop delivered.

  * We had to cancel our holiday plans as a result. We were going to a house in the country with some friends, it really sucks that we can't go â€“ the timing is terrible. Also typical that we can go an entire pandemic without incident and then have to isolate the day before a trip. Oh well, we're still taking the time off as it's much needed.

  * On a positive note, cancelling our rental car paid for the 18 bottles of Champagne we ordered for the trip. It'll last us a bit longer now too.

  * I don't have COVID. Charlotte's test results haven't arrived yet but hopefully she's negative too.

  * My [mortgage deck access appeal](/weeknotes/35/) was unsuccessful, so moving onto application #3. It feels like maybe it's a good thing, because some new rates came onto the market and this new mortgage is considerably cheaper overall, so I think this is positive? Also, they're fine with deck access so :fingers_crossed:

  * A lot of TV is happening in isolation.

  * We're watching Too Hot to Handle, which is a nice level of trashy. I think Cam looks like [Simon Legg](https://twitter.com/simonleggsays) and Cillian Murphy had a baby. I want to be in a beautiful villa in the sun please, but with nicer people.

  * We picked The West Wing back up (it's my first time, no spoilers please). Holy shit the final episodes of Season 4 though! I'm not used to this show making me feel so on-edge.

  * I've been enjoying Loki so much. Charlotte refuses to watch anything Marvel-related, I can't get enough of it and I recognise at this point I'm just going to keep throwing money at Disney until they stop making them or I die.

  * Charlotte and I started playing [Planet Coaster](https://www.planetcoaster.com/) together, we both liked Roller Coaster Tycoon as kids and this feels like a spiritual successor. It's fun so far, but _way_ more involved than Two Point Hospital.

  * I added a shortcut to switch between next/previous weeknotes (to be more [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/)). You can use the arrow buttons at the top of this post, or you can use the left/right arrow keys.
