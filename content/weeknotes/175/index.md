  * We said goodbye to Rocky this week, he went home on Wednesday. He was a delight, v chilled cat. I spent a few days being careful not to kick a nonexistent animal, weird how quickly you get used to having them around.

  * On Saturday we went on Rhys' leaving hike which is a really lovely idea. There were 16 of us in total and we went on an extremely muddy walk up Leith Hill and back. It was a joy seeing Leaf for the first time in _ages_ :heart:
  
    Once back in London we had a few drinks near Victoria and gossiped a bunch.

  * Charlotte got sick early in the week and then got better and I seem to have dodged it, though I _am_ feeling exhausted. Too tired to edit a cat/hike photo into this weeknote.

  * Today we went to visit JPD and David and meet their new(ish) baby. Very cute. She cried the first time I held her but warmed up towards us all by the end.

  * Work this week was a little dominated by a security incident. Although it's always a bit of a pain I'm reminded of how readily people at the FT come together when we need to act quickly :+1:

  * I'm becoming an AI bore. I can see people glazing over a little when I start talking about it, I need to pick my moments maybe. But now you're on my website I can moan as much as I want about how [email-based AI worms](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/03/researchers-create-ai-worms-that-can-spread-from-one-system-to-another/) are probably a thing we need to worry about, that [plagiarism is rampant](https://www.axios.com/2024/02/22/copyleaks-openai-chatgpt-plagiarism), or that the AI bubble is driving a [massive surge in energy and water usage](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/02/ais-craving-for-data-is-matched-only-by-a-runaway-thirst-for-water-and-energy?ref=mc.news). How about the fact that the companies launching these AI products have helped enable [lawyers to work on child custody cases](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/29/canada-lawyer-chatgpt-fake-cases-ai), middle-school kids to [make and distribute fake nude photos of their classmates](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/02/opinion/deepfakes-teenagers.html), or military forces to [decide which school or hospital to fire missiles at](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/03/israel-ai-warfare-gaza-00144491). At least I can make pretty pictures for my slide decks and search my work email a little bit faster though, eh?
