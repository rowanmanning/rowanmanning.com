  * We started the week with a new prime minister. Hooray. It's interesting to work for a newspaper when this stuff happens because we get a lot more traffic and we're all slightly more on-edge in case the website falls over.

  * Later in the week, the queen died. It's interesting to work for a newspaper when this stuff happens because we get a lot more traffic and we're all slightly more on-edge in case the website falls over.

  * I don't feel particularly impacted by the news. It'll be slightly odd, because she's been a feature of British society for so long, but also abolish the monarchy.

  * The flat above ours started leaking water through the kitchen and bathroom ceilings :grimacing: on the plus side I met my upstairs neighbour finally.

  * Mara was in town and hosted some birthday drinks near our flat, so we went along and drank a bit much for a weekday.

    I've been playing with [starryai](https://www.starryai.com/), it's weirdly addictive to generate images when a prompt comes up in conversation. Here's "a girl named Charlotte but instead of a brain there's a dark void".

  * We're away on holiday in Wales for a week now. We rented a ridiculously huge farmhouse with a bunch of friends.

    * We have two hot tubs, and I'm going to go and sit in one with a beer immediately after publishing this weeknote.

    * Waterbeds are weird and sloshy.

    * We're doing some nice communal cooking, cosy fires, and long walks.

    * Today we walked 8.5 miles to the nearest McDonald's.

    * This is the moon over the fields behind the farmhouse, it's pretty out here.
