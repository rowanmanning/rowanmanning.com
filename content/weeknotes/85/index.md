  * I'm back in London for a few days, feeling very relaxed. Actually looking forward to working for a couple of days, but not looking forward to mountains of Slack messages and emails to sort through.

  * We got back in time for Tammy's birthday drinks, which got a little messy. Her mum (a Masterchef finalist) made food which was amazing.

  * We finished watching The Ultimatum. Wild. The reunion could have been a little spicier but you can't have it all eh?

  * On Wednesday we're flying to Costa Rica for June holiday #2. I'm really excited, we're doing a little less lounging for this one and staying in 5 different places over the two weeks, I think it's gonna be a lot of fun. We're going with Tammy and Alison and it's both Charlotte and Tammy's birthdays while we're out there :tada:

  * [Adam](https://mobile.twitter.com/uxtremist), who's back in London, is gonna stay in our flat for the weeks we're away. His being in London and needing a place to stay while we're away is very serendipitous.

  * I'm not gonna take a laptop this time and so it's unlikely I'll bother trying to publish weeknotes from my phone.

  * I'm gonna relax so hard. Byee :wave:
