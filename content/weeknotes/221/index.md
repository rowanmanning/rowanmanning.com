  * I've been sick all week, exhausting. It's been a while since anything hit me or Charlotte this hard, just gross. Not a lot to write about really

  * I took Monday off work and then half-worked for the rest of the week, just doing boring and repetitive things (e.g. dependency bumps) to keep me occupied. It was about the right speed.

  * Sickness has meant a lot of TV. Skeleton Crew was so great, the Disney+ Star Wars series have been a little mixed for me but this felt simultaneously new and exciting but scratched a few nostalgic itches. Think "The Goonies in space".

  * I wasn't gonna watch The Traitors but binged it all in one sitting because I ran out of other stuff. It's alright isn't it, like it's entertaining but I don't get the massive hype. I'll probs watch the rest now though.

  * I had the weekend alone because as soon as Charlotte felt well enough she escaped off to the Lake District. It's been nice hanging out with the cats and doing my own thing.

  * On Saturday, feeling a lot better, I went to a housewarming and it was a lovely time. I had a few drinks, ate excellent food, and was home early enough to play some Factorio.
