  * The Celebrity Traitors is pretty good TV, isn't it? I'm enjoying it a lot, it's far less stressful and fraught than the regular series though just as infuriating how wrong everyone is. I'm living for Alan Carr and Cat Burns.

  * On Friday we went along to a pub quiz with a few friends at a Squash club where one of their dads plays. We came a respectable fourth but, more importantly, the kids table beat the parents table :+1:

    We attended the counter-protest in Whitechapel despite UKIP being sent off elsewhere already, it was a lovely community-spirited day where people from all over the borough came together to loudly tell the fascists to fuck off.

  * We made Christmas Cakes with Alison. We had some wine, listened to Christmas music, and had a lovely time. We grabbed some impromptu arepas with J&C in the evening, what a nice chilled Sunday!

  * Charlotte and I started playing Blue Prince which is a really fun little puzzle game. I expect it'll quickly frustrate us but so far it's great, we're enjoying exploring a large manor where the rooms change each day. It comes highly recommended and so far I can see why!

  * I'm trying Apple Music to see if I can _finally_ ditch Spotify, I have a three month trial. So far it may be convincing me that it's better, I think the auto-playlist stuff is better and I'm also happy that artists are paid a little more. I was also able to move all my music across easily :tada:
