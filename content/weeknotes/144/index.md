  * I don't like [Terraform](/weeknotes/143/) any more, I accidentally deleted 21 of my GitHub repos and then had to spend several hours restoring them from backups. Dangerous stuff!

  * I participated in a hackathon at work and won the Judge's Choice award despite a tenuous link to the theme. I spent the day running [njsscan](https://github.com/ajinabraham/njsscan#readme) against all our Node.js repos and building an interface around it to make it easier to assess results.

    I won a small green robot that clearly states on the box _this is not a toy, it's for adult collectors_. It was really fun, there were some excellent hacks and presentations and I'm glad I joined in this year.

  * We went out for dinner and drinks with Alison on Friday which was lovely. We ended up going to Oslo in Hackney, which was a bad idea. The night was fun until we tried to extend it beyond the natural end! I didn't feel my best on Saturday morning.

  * On Saturday afternoon, having recovered a bit, we went to Tammy's parents' 40th wedding anniversary which was lovely. Her mum is a Masterchef finalist and runs a catering company so the food was incredible. A few cocktails down I felt fine again.

  * A lot of new shelves arrived for our office, which means we'll be able to unpack the final two boxes. So exciting! Then the dominos will continue to fall â€“ we'll be able to get rid of our second sofa, get a table and chairs, and finish off everything :clap:
