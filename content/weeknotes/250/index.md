  * Weeknote 250! Only 10 more to go until we're at the five year mark. Have you noticed I switched to Mondays? It's because I _really_ can't be bothered on a Sunday any more, too many fun plans and good videogames to play.

  * Speaking of, I finished Baldur's Gate III, it's hard to overstate how much I loved this game and seeing the ending for each of my companions was very heartwarming. Not quite ready for another play through but I know I missed a _lot_ and I want to try some different decisions/companions/endings.

  * As a less story-driven game (I thought) I picked up Crusader Kings III in the Steam sale and I've barely scratched the surface of just how wildly complex this game is. I keep making rookie mistakes like forgetting to switch to Primogeniture and having my realm divided into tiny counties for each of my children :facepalm: anyway it's less casual than I expected.

  * I joined a different gym, very boring but it's closer to home so I'm more likely to go :fingers_crossed: it has a badminton court so I might try that.

    There was some drinking after work, drinking in Whitechapel. Then there was a large protest and we saw a lot of people get arrested. Then we did some more drinking in Lambeth. Not all on the same day, all very nice.

  * My motivation's back at work which is nice. Doing some interesting stuff around bot management which is scratching an itch of mine (building an API) and time at work has been passing quickly.
