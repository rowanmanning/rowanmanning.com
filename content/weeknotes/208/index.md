  * On Tuesday, Charlotte and I went to eat Vietnamese food and watch Rose Matafeo who was excellent :+1:

  * It's been a heavy board game week with Euan around.

  * I had games with my regular group on Wednesday, mostly playing smaller party games. Then on Saturday we met up with Euan and played [Photosynthesis](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/218603/photosynthesis).

  * On Sunday we headed over to JPD and David's and played a very long game of [Twilight Inscription](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/361545/twilight-inscription). It's fun but pretty involved - by the end of the game I knew just about what I was supposed to be doing.

  * Guess why this weeknote is lacking in detail? I've got a week off. I'm doing nothing and it's glorious, I don't even want to be writing this weeknote. I'm going to download [Factorio: Space Age](https://factorio.com/buy-space-age) as soon as it's available and rot in front of my screen but in the fun way instead of the work way.

  * Oh one thing I did which I'm pleased with - I made it possible for 78 of the FT's Node.js apps to reduce their dependencies by ~100MB. Don't install AWS SDK v2 folks.
