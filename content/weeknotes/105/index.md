  * [Concordia](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/124361/concordia) is a fun board game. We've played before but I got into it a lot more this time around. All the mechanics feel quite neat and polished.

  * I feel like I shipped a lot of code this week. We started rolling out a replacement for our fatal error handling, which will eventually allow us to burn down a [haunted forest](https://increment.com/software-architecture/exit-the-haunted-forest/) that I've had my eye on since the beginning of the year.

  * I've also been playing around with a new solution for logging. For historical reasons, we have three large and complicated logging libraries for FT.com. I _think_ (thanks to writing a massive test suite) I've condensed all of these into a new very simple [Pino](https://getpino.io/)-based alternative. I'm having fun!

      On Saturday we went to a Halloween party, I kept it simple with an understated (and easy to remove) Number 10 Downing Street costume. It's been a scary thing.

      I broke out my craft supplies and spent ages constructing the letterbox, but then I ran out of steam and couldn't be bothered to make a 3D doorknob.

      The party was really fun, the Sunday afterwards was less fun.

  * We started watching Love is Blind season 3. I _think_ it's maybe getting a little over-produced and I'm not as attached to anyone as in the previous seasons. There are some disaster people and plenty of walking red flags.

  * I'm switching more of my online social stuff to Mastodon now that Musk owns Twitter. I don't think it's gonna be a nice place to be. It's probs not been that nice for a long time and Mastodon seems quite chill and friendly. I'm [@rowan@hachyderm.io](https://hachyderm.io/@rowan).
