  * I managed not to catch Charlotte's gross illness at all, which I'm very pleased about. She's all good now, so we've had a more busy week.

  * In [week 203](/weeknotes/203/) we won a pub quiz at The Parakeet, which is a nice pub. Well this week, on Tuesday, we _finally_ got together to go back and spend our £75 bar tab. It was a fun night and unfortunately we now have a new £75 bar tab to spend so I guess we'll have to go back again :smirk:

    I won us a bonus 5 points again in the drawing round, this time drawing the best "Parakeet doing the caber toss". We also came second in the newspaper tower building contest and got 20/20 on the noughties bangers music round.

  * Thursday was [Luke](https://lukeblaney.co.uk/)'s leaving do. It was super well-attended and I had fun. My aging body decided to take things into his own hands and made _every_ drink give me heartburn, so I didn't have an awful lot. Too many highlights to mention, a good send-off.

  * We'd booked Friday evening in for hangover food and TV, only Alison was well enough to make it to ours and we started watching [The Residence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Residence_(TV_series)) which I _loved_ (Charlotte and I finished it over the weekend).

  * On Saturday we went to Thai and Pie, a local place that is (you guessed it) a fusion of Thai cuisine and Pie and Mash. We've been slowly working through a very long list of restaurants to try.

    It's not really fusion, pretty standard pie flavours/accompaniments and also everything you'd expect from a Thai menu in the UK. It was all great but I was kind of hoping for Pad Thai _in_ a pie or something equally horrifying.

  * We used some bonus money to book flights to Singapore and Cambodia in July. It's actually happening now which means I can get excited about it.

  * The lads (well, Tom Barnaby, who is more adventurous) have worked out they can use the counter and fridge as springboards to get up on top of the kitchen cupboards. They did it to shame us - it's _so_ dusty up there and they're walking feather dusters. Douglas Fir was sad about not being up there and we had to show him how, the adorable little airhead.
