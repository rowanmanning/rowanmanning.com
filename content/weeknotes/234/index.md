  * I did a few quick illustrations for a presentation at work, which was fun and scratched a creative itch. Maybe I need to nudge myself to draw more regularly again or break out the paints, embrace art. Those LLMs aren't gonna train themselves amirite?

  * Over the long weekend we drove up to Lancashire to hang out in Morecambe and the surrounding area. We spent Friday evening in Blackpool, saw the sights, played the arcades, ate the chips, sang the karaoke, and stayed in a £40/night hotel (breakfast included). It was fun! It's less grim than I was led to expect.

  * On Saturday we dragged ourselves back to Morecambe. We did execeptionally well at being living humans - some shopping, a walk along the prom, and making a couple of pavlovas. Early night.

    Sunday involved a long walk around Arnside and Silverdale, the weather and countryside were beautiful – it was a perfect morning for a walk. We sat and admired 120 square miles of mud flats with our lunch.

    Later in the day we went to visit Alison's friends for a Sunday roast, which was incredible. The pavlovas went down a treat too.

  * Today we drove home. It took 7.5 hours instead of 4ish because every single motorway had issues. I'm very tired, I deserve the bed now. The lads were pleased to see us after their first weekend with intermittent visits from a cat-sitter.
