  * I picked up Cities: Skylines II again this week and played a little bit in the evenings. The latest patches have made the game feel a lot more polished and I'm enjoying noodling about in my new cities.

  * Still not getting anywhere near my holiday reading speed, I picked up [The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August by Claire North](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35066358-the-first-fifteen-lives-of-harry-august). I'm 75% of the way through and loving it so far; It follows a man who, whenever he dies, returns to his birth with his full memory. It's been good adding several women in Science Fiction to the list of authors I like: I noticed I kept picking up stuff written by men because it's what kept getting recommended.

  * On Friday we went to listen to Sean Paul from Finsbury Park and drank some champagne on a bench. The sound wasn't great but then I suppose they don't optimise for "people sat way behind the wall trying to get some free music". Then we headed to a party nearby, met lots of people, and drank Sambuca.

  * When we got home we found that the cats had pissed on the bed and shat on the sofa. We'll chat to a vet but normally this'd be a sign of anxiety at their age. I think we've increased the time they're by themselves a bit too quickly and will readjust to spending shorter times with nobody in the flat. Poor pissy lads.

    They're doing a cute thing at the moment where they _love_ being in the bath. If I shower then they'll rush in afterwards and sit in the wet bath very still until the motion-activated light turns off. They don't seem to mind being damp.

  * On Sunday I popped up to see my extended family to celebrate my grandma's birthday in a park. As usual, it was nice to see everyone, however, these large group things mean I barely feel like I caught up with anyone. I was originally going to hire a car and drive up but, embarrassingly, I booked it for the wrong weekend. I only found this out after the person at the car hire place spent 15 minutes trying to find my booking :facepalm:
