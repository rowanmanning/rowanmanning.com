  * A very quiet week. After last weekend Charlotte and I independently decided to be more healthy, it's far easier when both of us are trying. I did some more exercise than usual (nearly nothing) and we're suddenly cooking healthy lunches and dinners again. I feel better.

  * Gin doesn't make me as happy as beer, but what're you gonna do. Gin and tomato juice is a good way to stop myself drinking too fast.

  * Our weekend plans fell through so Charlotte and I walked up to Walthamstow Wetlands and didn't get lost this time. We took a route through London Fields and Hackney Downs, mostly via side streets, and it was lovely. We had a little pub dinner by the river and then home. The weather was perfect - sunny but not too hot. We saw some goslings.

  * On Sunday we wandered down to Shadwell to watch the London Marathon for a little while. Our friend Ari was running and it was fun waving as she passed the half way point.

  * [Two Point Museum](https://www.twopointstudios.com/en/games/two-point-museum) continues to be great, we're into a good rhythm and re-learning how to compromise on our differing design styles.

  * Look at this lad. Not a care in the world.
