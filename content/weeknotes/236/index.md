  * What a beautiful week! Sun, shorts, feeling happy, Psoriasis clearing up a little.

  * I wasn't even that pissed off when we had another leak from upstairs. This time it was their boiler leaking through the kitchen and bathroom :thumbs_up: not gonna fix anything until after July when our upstairs neighbour is giving their plumbing a much-needed overhaul.

  * We had our first closed Unite meeting on Wednesday and I feel pretty happy about how it went and the direction we're moving in. I've put my name forward to be a rep so I can work on our membership data and a comms plan, areas that interest me (and I'm good at if I say so myself).

  * We took the lads for their vaccination top-ups, we've completely failed at preventing them from hating the carrier :shrug: the new vet was very nice, and by very nice I mean she lavished my cats with the appropriate amount of praise.

  * I had a two day hangover which wasn't great. What _was_ great was the joint Unite and {{< abbr "National Union of Journalists" >}}NUJ{{< /abbr >}} drinks for International Workers' Day. Meeting more colleagues and organisers from Editorial was excellent, as a far more established union they've been so friendly and helpful.

  * On Saturday we met up with Charlotte's family to get through all our Christmas gifts. We did a [Hidden City](https://www.inthehiddencity.com/) treasure hunt around Marylebone and Mayfair and then had dinner at [Dans le Noir](https://london.danslenoir.com/). It's an _experience_ eating in pitch darkness, gonna be honest I switched from cutlery to hands very quickly.

    What was really interesting is that we talked loads more. Chatting to people is far less exhausting when you don't have to move your face, gesticulate, or look like you're paying attention.

  * We caught up with Gallal and went for a lovely long walk through some Oxfordshire countryside, a good mix of woodland and fields and not too hilly. Exactly what I needed to end the weekend and make me feel more wholesome.
