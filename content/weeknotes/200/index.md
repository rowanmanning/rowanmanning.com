  * Here we are at another arbitrary milestone, 200 weeknotes :rocket: I've written nearly 72,000 words of them so far. That's roughly the same as Treasure Island. Feel free to spend ~7 hours reading them all.

  * ~~It wasn't a very eventful week really.~~ I thought it wasn't eventful but, after writing all the stuff we did, it was quite busy!

  * I've been playing [Shapez 2](https://shapez2.com/) quite obsessively, it's in early release at the moment but it's really polished and _such_ a fun factory builder.

  * On Thursday we went to [Not Another Quiz Night](https://www.notanotherquiznight.com/) with Tammy and Marcus which was a lot of fun. I think we came 5th out of 25+ teams :clap: we went to Grasso in Soho before and tbh I wouldn't bother again, pretty underwhelming considering the price.

  * On Friday we popped over to J&C's for cocktails. Due to hand injuries and general laziness I made all the cocktails and thoroughly enjoyed it. The aim was to try and find uses for the Cognac in the cupboard, turns out there are plenty of great ones: [Ampersands](https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/2246/ampersand-cocktail) are delicious, [Burnt Fuselages](https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/4912/burnt-fuselage) are delicious, [Sidecars](https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/4791/sidecar) are delicious, and [Landing Gears](https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/4913/landing-gear) are delicious.

  * On Saturday we had a fry up in [Cafe Donatella](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7dAkoJ2RGDk9WNFD7) and then lazed around a lot.

  * Douglas Fir pissed on the bed again. At least the duvet fits in the washing machine. It's our fault, we left the litter trays a few days longer and they didn't smell good; bad cat owners. We've resolved to be better, not _just_ because pissy beds are a pain.

    On Sunday Charlotte and I went to Searcys because we had a gift voucher. We went for bottomless champagne and a roast, we managed a bottle each which is reasonable. Then we met Luke in Mr Fogg's for cocktails; we bumped into another FT person, small world eh? We went to a few other bars and I fell asleep in my clothes :thumbs_up: this is what bank holidays are for right?

  * We don't talk about Monday.
