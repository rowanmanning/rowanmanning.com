  * On Wednesday I went to a private view with Scarlett, who I haven't seen in ages. The exhibition was for a collective of artists who have stayed with her a few times ([Mawwdach Residency](https://www.mawddachresidency.com/)) and it was an experience! I'm still not sure what I witnessed but it was fun.

  * We went for Japanese food at [Tenshi](https://www.tenshilondon.com/) which has been on my list for a while, it captures the vibes of an [Izakaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izakaya) well and the food was great!

  * Over a long weekend we took a trip back up to Skegness, this time it wasn't for a [Butlins Weekender](/weeknotes/125/) but tbh the first night was just as messy. We accidentally drank three bottles of wine each in the hot tub and didn't feel great the next day.

  * The house we stayed in was a work of art, and the owner was... I know this is a loaded term... a character. We could overlook the occasional impracticality because it was like living in a fever dream, kind of in a good way? It was also probably an electrician's worst nightmare.

  * On Sunday we managed to drag ourselves out into town. I think Skegness gets an unjustified bad name - I've been to _far_ more run down seaside towns, I dare say it was charming. We had a fry up, wandered along the beach, played crazy golf, and ate fish and chips.

  * We broke up the drive home with a little walk near Anglesey Abbey and got quite muddy. I'm enjoying driving and London isn't scary any more, which is saying a lot - I learned in small villages and country roads.

  * The lads were pleased to see us, and we were pleased to sleep in our own beds in a less intense house.
