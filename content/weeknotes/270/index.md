  * I'll be honest it's been a more tiring week than a festive one, I'm exhausted. We drove up to Hull on the 23rd to stay in an Airbnb again. The lads were well-behaved and there were no tinsel incidents. I forgot to say it was their second birthday last week :pleading_face:

  * On Christmas Eve we had a relaxed day, watched The Muppet Christmas Carol, and drank a little bit.

  * Christmas was nice, I woke up quite early and did a load of veg prep and then we all worked on dinner together. Really the overriding feeling was exhaustion, I took myself off for a little nap after dinner. The lads were shy and didn't hang out with us loads.

  * On Boxing day we drove back to London and had an early night, and yesterday I popped up to visit my family. We played Herd Mentality which was fun and I continued to eat a lot of cheese.

  * One of our presents for the lads was this fancy new drinking cup (they'll only drink from pint-shaped drinking vessels).
