  * This week's poor decision was overdoing it at some leaving drinks on Tuesday. Oops.

  * {{< pin right >}}{{< image "echo-worldmap.png" >}}{{< /pin >}}

    I'm doing a lot of world-building at the moment for  {{< abbr "Dungeons & Dragons" >}}D&amp;D{{< /abbr >}} and having such a great time with it. I finally decided to shell out for [Inkarnate](https://inkarnate.com/) and map-making has been a joy. I have a world map, a calendar system, an extensive cast of non-player characters, and a loose plan for a couple of sessions. I'm excited! What I want to do is share my excellent battle-maps here but a couple of players read these so no spoilers.

  * I think I'm enjoying the 2024 D&D rules, now that I'm reading through the books more. Character creation makes a little more sense to me and I think you end up with a load more interesting options.

  * Popped down to Brighton over the weekend. I hung out with my sister for a while which was delighfiul, we had a few drinks and I met her new boyfriend. Then Charlotte came down and we stayed at her brother's new place.

  * Off to Edinburgh and Huddersfield next week, looking forward to the time off.
