  * I finally had an appointment with a doctor and have been referred to a gastroenterologist, so that's great. I'll book the appointment in once I'm back from Germany.

  * I prioritised my food reintroductions around a mix of stuff that will be commonly available but also low(ish) risk items that unlock a lot more dishes generally. I can beef and pork (not that I often do, just low risk), I can eat onions, and I can eat dairy. Those last two are _big_ and I'm pleased they don't seem to be the cause of my gut issues :+1:

    Having milk in coffee/tea again sparks a lot of joy, coconut milk just isn't the same.

  * On Wednesday I DMed the second session of our little Dungeons and Dragons adventure, I had _loads_ of fun and everyone kinda slipped into character more comfortably. The group fought an Owlbear and decided against killing it (eventually), it was fun to see them resolve a combat less violently but also meant they didn't feel guilty when they found out the Owlbear was being magically influenced. I love this game.

  * We're in Bonn with Gallal, Luke, and Adam and it's been fun so far. We're in a weird little apartment where the kitchen is in one of the bedrooms.

    Yesterday we took a train down into the hills south of the city and walked through a lot of vineyards. We found a wine vending machine quite far out of town but it had been vandalised. We stopped off in an old monastery that's now a winery. Delightful. I ate some Flammkuchen.
