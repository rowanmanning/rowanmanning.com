  * We took the day off on Wednesday so Charlotte could go and look at a house. It was kind of perfect :grimacing: second viewing this week maybe? We took our (shared) car up which meant my day off was just 7 hours of driving, but it was fun!

  * Had a classic "Rowan & Arjun get carried away" evening on Thursday. We both should have gone home at the same time as everyone else. We did not.

  * Over the weekend we stayed in Huddersfield with L&A and attended "Bottomless Crunch", 90 minutes of unlimited crisps from a huge variety. We tried a lot of different crisps; I felt _so_ oily afterwards. I think I prefer an ROI Tayto to an NI one.
