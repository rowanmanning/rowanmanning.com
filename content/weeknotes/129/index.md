  * I've been playing a lot of [OpenTTD](https://www.openttd.org/) (a free and open-source clone of [Transport Tycoon Deluxe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Tycoon#Transport_Tycoon_Deluxe), a 90s classic). It's _such_ a good game! It takes a while to get used to the controls and I was slow to remember how to run trains but I'm having a lot of fun now. I might try a few mods soon or run a little server.

  * I'm still going strong with [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) too. I'm up to 150,000,000,000 cookies per second. At least it's mostly an idle clicker now, I just check in every once in a while to spend my hard-earned cookies.

    On Friday we met up with Jenn & Chris for a whisky tasting. It was really chill, the bar we were at was nice and quiet, and we went for some great Thai food afterwards. My favourite new (to me) whisky was the Benromach 10 which has some nice black pepperiness to it.

  * The weekend was quiet, which I definitely needed. I'm feeling a little stressed about how booked-up my life is lately.

    Charlotte and I went for food at [Needoo Grill](https://needoogrill.co.uk/) (better than Lahore and Tayyabs :eyes:) and then wandered up Brick Lane for a drink. We didn't do any of the house jobs we were supposed to do :massage:
