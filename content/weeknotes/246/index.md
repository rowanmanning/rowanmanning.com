  * After an uneventful start to the week, on Wednesday we flew to Singapore. We lucked out and had an empty seat in our row so the 13 hour flight was comfortable. My foot is still painful but less so, I'm very slow and dosed up.

  * We landed early on Thursday, headed to Alison's friend's house where we're staying and slept until midday. We had a little swim in the pool and then set off to fill our day and try to combat jetlag.

    We visited Gardens by the Bay and walked around the cloud forest which was beautiful. We got misted a lot. We managed to push through and not fall asleep during the evening light show and went to bed at a sensible time.

    Woke up normally, no jetlag :tada: on Friday we spent the day at Universal Singapore. We managed the first couple of rides without queues but then spent a lot of the rest of the day standing and sweating. It was fun but it hasn't been great for my foot standing all day â€“ so much for my plan to lounge around. We got home in time for a quick dip.

    On Saturday we had a lazy morning then spent the rest of the day in central, mainly around Chinatown. We had a few drinks, had lunch at a Hawker market (all the food's been great so far), and then watched some practice fireworks for Signapore's 60th birthday. A Singapore Sling and then bed.

  * Yesterday we took the cable car over to Sentosa island which is beautiful, perfect tropical beaches juxtaposed with masses of container ships out at sea. We spent the day on the beach (and in beach bars) before grabbing some late night dim sum.
