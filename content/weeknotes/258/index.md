  * Because we missed his party, we went for a birthday meal with Luke. We went to [Abeno](https://www.abeno.co.uk/menu) and had excellent okonomiyaki.

  * The week has been quite quiet. I played a new (to me) boardgame, [A Feast for Odin](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/177736/a-feast-for-odin); it's a really fun worker placement game with an overwhelming number of options. Other than that I've continued to expand _Greater Cornwall_ in {{< abbr "Crusader Kings 3" >}}CK3{{< /abbr >}} â€“ France, Germany, Poland, and half of Italy are now under Cornish rule. I unseated the pope to help spread a religion that allows women to rule :+1: I'm an equal opportunities tyrannical conqueror.

  * My mouse's scroll wheel stopped working and, [like the PS5 controllers](/weeknotes/225/), I decided to take it apart and try to fix it instead of adding some more plastic and precious metals to landfill. I took it all apart, gave everything a good clean, put it back together and it works again! It was gross in there.

  * For her birthday a while ago Charlotte was gifted a novelty photo shoot and, friends, the result is pretty great :joy: it's going on our wall.
