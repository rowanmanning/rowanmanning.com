  * Pancake day this week! We invited Alison round and I made far too many pancakes but they were excellent. Pizza pancakes (oregano-marinated tomatoes, cheese, crispy bacon) were the best.

    On Friday we went to see the [Old Dirty Brasstards](https://www.olddirtybrasstards.co.uk/) do pop-punk. It was excellent, just a big singalong and they covered most of the greats. I'd definitely go and see them again, maybe 00s hits next time :eyes:

  * It turns out Charlotte had never been picked up from an event by a boyfriend which meant me driving to pick her up from a wedding on Saturday was a big exciting event. We got a McDonalds drive through on the way home. It was weird and nostalgic being able to do this now we have access to a car; it was fun despite the entire 40-minute journey being in 20mph zones.

  * At work, our new product manager (Lee) joined properly this week and it's been excellent already. Our previous PMs were good, though they started fresh at the company â€“ it shouldn't surprise me how much more organised and smooth things can be when a new team member already knows how the business works. He's already succeeded in making me _interested_ in some {{< abbr title="Search Engine Optimisation" >}}SEO{{< /abbr >}} work instead of slightly dreading how we manage all the stakeholders.

  * Also at work, I'm having to suck up helping our teams navigate a revised incident review process despite believing that it didn't need to change. Silver lining: I get to practice giving difficult in-person feedback and at least I get to prove that I can get on with work I disagree with, pretty uncommon for my team :joy:
