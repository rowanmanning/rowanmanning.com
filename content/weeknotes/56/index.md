  * Choosing paint is hard! [Thanks, Matt for the ranking](https://notes.matthinchliffe.dev/052.html#matt-s-paint-ranking-2021), it gave me even more colours to choose from :see_no_evil: The living room mess of patches is growing at an alarming rate. I think I currently light the rightmost brighter green in the middle, but who knows how I'll feel by next week.

  * I've been having a lot of fun with home automation. I bought some [Shelly Temperature and Humidity sensors](https://shelly.cloud/products/shelly-humidity-temperature-smart-home-automation-sensor/) and set up a couple of dashboards with my Raspberry Pi dashboard and Grafana.

    My next step is to use this data to power dehumidifiers around the house and get a smart thermostat set up. I'm kind of leaning towards a Tado wireless thermostat which it's possible to integrate into my setup without giving more data to Google or Amazon.

  * I spent the first half of the week [feeling really rough](/weeknotes/55/) and decided to skip the office so I don't spread it further. Unfortunately, this meant missing [Lee's visit](https://leemoody.co.uk/blog/weeknotes/60/) :pensive: fingers-crossed we can catch up next time!

  * By the weekend I was feeling a lot better. I went to play board games in person for the first time in ages, followed by a bottomless brunch (somehow feeling OK after that). Played a couple of great new games:

    * [Whirling Witchcraft](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/335275/whirling-witchcraft) is a nice quick game and easy to pick up. There's a bit of engine building but the pace of the game means it's not super heavy on tactics.

    * [Nidavellir](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/293014/nidavellir) is _kind_ of similar to 7 Wonders, I found it nearly impossible to hold a mental model of the scoring, but it was still fun â€“ hopefully, I'll do better next time.
