    The [exclusion diet](/weeknotes/271/) continues and I've been going for two weeks now. I'm fine :+1: better than fine, even. Some of this could just be that I'm not eating anything processed, or maybe there _is_ gonna be a clear trigger food once I start reintroducing. Anyway Charlotte thinks I'm happier and who can blame me – I'm averaging one poo per day which is far more healthy than&hellip; well&hellip; more than that.

  	As you can see from my food tracking diary, I have a great gut. One more week and I'll introduce a new food, I think it's still quite likely to be some delicious delicious potatoes.

  * I bought Finspan but haven't played it yet, excited to try it though. My boardgame group played [The Guild of Merchant Explorers](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/350933/guild-merchant-explorers), it's been long enough that they forgot I win every time. I won.

  * My smugness at winning didn't last long because I got sick, as did Charlotte. We were a couple of snotty lads for the latter half of the week and I had some time off work to rest and watch shit TV. Feeling just about normal now.

  * There's a lot of {{< abbr "Dungeons & Dragons" >}}D&amp;D{{< /abbr >}} news, I'm very excited. Firstly I'm going to a group with Luke soon and get to be a player rather than a DM, it's gonna be great.
  
    Secondly I dusted off my printer and laminator and I've been going _really_ hard on my printouts for the session I'm running this coming week. I purchased some sealing wax and dug out all my old pre-aged paper, I hope my players are excited to receive a bunch of letters and paperwork from imaginary people.
