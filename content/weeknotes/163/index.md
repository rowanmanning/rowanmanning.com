  * I'm very tired. None of these bullet points will exceed 13.7 words.

  * [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) was fun until day ten part two. No thanks.

  * We had an all-day planning session. It surprised me by being excellent.

  * Our first Christmas Party was great. Long queues, good Old Fashioneds, dancing.

  * Friday was a bad day. See above.

  * We went on a hike over the weekend. Bumped into an ex-colleague.

  * We put up our tree, our living room feels festive.
