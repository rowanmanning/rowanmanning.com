  * This week was the annual FT rounders game where several teams from Product & Technology either ran around Regent's Park or sat on the grass and ate/drank. It was a fun day as always but my bag got stolen at the pub afterwards. The joke's on the thief: there was nothing in it except a jacket, some suncream, and a bottle of water. Shame about the bag though.

  * I released an updated OpenTelemetry library for internal FT use which will stop us from having to copy the same boilerplate (10 dependencies and 60 lines of code) across 200+ repos. I'm really quite excited to get a blog post written and start getting our teams to try it out next week :clap:

  * We had Thursday and Friday off work because it's Charlotte's birthday! We didn't do a lot on Thursday except make it to a local greasy spoon. On Friday we went to a food festival in Chelmsford, drank some wine, and danced to [Symphonic Ibiza](https://www.symphonicibiza.com/).

  * On Saturday, all our plans fell through so Charlotte and I had a lazy morning and then went for the tasting menu at [Mallow](https://mallowlondon.com/) which serves incredible vegan food.

  * On Sunday we went for a roast at Charlotte's dad's and spent the day with family. Somehow my first time having rice and peas with a roast, great addition. Charlotte's nephew was there and being cute, he's _nearly_ walking.

  * My reading rate has dropped a lot, partly because of all the drinking but I'm also finding [The Left Hand of Darkness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18423.The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness) to be a bit of a slow burn. It's _great_ but the characters haven't reeled me in to the same extent as some other recent reads.
