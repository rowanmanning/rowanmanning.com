  * We had a couple more days to ourselves this week, we took it easy with a few small walks. On Wednesday we drove into Yorkshire to view a house that Charlotte was thinking of buying, it wasn't quite right but we have more of an idea what she's looking for now.

  * Charlotte and I finally got around to playing [Ark Nova](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/342942/ark-nova), a board game I bought a while ago. We played twice over two evenings (very wholesome) and won a game each. It's firmly one of my favourites now.

  * Luke and Alison arrived on Thursday and we got boozy enough that I couldn't stomach a Full English the next day – unheard of. I spent a lot of the next day enduring waves of nausea. In the evening we managed to cook a healthy dinner and I felt a lot better after a vegetable.

    Obviously we walked to Thor's Cave several more times, with different variations on how we got there. I didn't realise how deep it went, we barely scratched the surface last time.

  * On Saturday we drove to Matlock to see what the town's like and also another house viewing. Again, not quite right, but we both love Matlock – it's just the right size of town and is easy to get to from London. We spent the rest of the day walking and visiting tea rooms.

  * Towards the evening we drove over to Matlock Bath which is like a seaside town by a river, odd but fun. We played mini golf, looked around an aquarium, and ate fish and chips.

  * On Sunday we walked to an excellent pub a couple of villages over and ate a roast. In the evening we played Ready Steady Cook. We split into teams, bought ingredients for the other team, and then had to make several small plates. Charlotte and I made a cassoulet which won it for us :tada: it was fun but a bit of a nightmare with four people cooking at the same time in a rental kitchen.
