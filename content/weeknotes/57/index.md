  * Our house has a high risk of mould at the moment, which we're still trying to sort with dehumidifiers. There's a calculation I don't fully understand (which I'm now graphing in my home hub, of course) which does something with the average temperature, the coldest temperature in the house, and the average indoor vs outdoor humidity. Who knows _exactly_ what 77% mould risk means? Not me, but it seems too high.

  * Our beautiful desks arrived! We bought them from a carpenter on Etsy (turns out there are a lot of people who make furniture there), neither of us have ever spent actual money on a desk for ourselves before and it feels really nice considering how often we're still working at home. It means I can also sell the IKEA table I've been using and the much-hated dining table that Charlotte's been working on.

  * I won a quiz at work! I never win things so it was a nice surprise, you just had to know/guess the locations of various colleagues in photos they'd sent in. I knew a few and got lucky with the others. I need to decide what to spend the Â£50 Amazon Voucher on. Another dehumidifier maybe?

  * We went to [Tayyabs](http://www.tayyabs.co.uk/) with Euan, Aadil, and Saney partly to celebrate Charlotte getting her braces off and being able to eat Indian food again. It was delicious.

  * Charlotte's mum and brother spent all of Saturday visiting, which was lovely. We got through a bit of prosecco, went for a very cold walk, and played a bunch of Jackbox-like games. It felt quite wholesome.

  * It's that time of year again where I watch a _lot_ of Christmas films! IT'S CHRISTMAS! There are some pretty good new offerings so far.

    * [Love Hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Hard_(film)) was a really heart-warming and festive tale about catfishing people. I don't know about you lot, but I _love_ some dodgy morality in my Christmas films. I give it four bells :bell::bell::bell::bell:

    * [A California Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_California_Christmas) was a lot more serious than I was really ready for immediately after Love Hard. Once again lying about your identity is a key component, and I need to start thinking about who _I_ want to lie to over the festive period, I've clearly not been doing it enough. I give it three glasses of milk :milk_glass::milk_glass::milk_glass:

    * [12 Dates of Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Dates_of_Christmas) had it all. I had no idea that Amy Smart starred in a time loop Christmas film way back in 2011. Features less lying than the other two (but not _zero_ lying so it's still festive). This made me feel quite warm and fuzzy, who doesn't love a redemption arc? I give it four places of worship :place_of_worship::place_of_worship::place_of_worship::place_of_worship:

    * I saved the best for last of course, [The Princess Switch 3: Romancing the Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Switch_3:_Romancing_the_Star) was excellent. The third instalment after [The Princess Switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Switch) (my favourite Christmas film, :wrapped_gift::wrapped_gift::wrapped_gift::wrapped_gift::wrapped_gift:) and [The Princess Switch: Switched Again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Switch:_Switched_Again) (:snowman::snowman::snowman:) really delivered and was an improvement on the first sequel. It also keeps building on the [Netflix Holiday Movie Universe](https://netflix-holiday-movie-universe.fandom.com/wiki/Netflix_Holiday_Movie_Universe_Wiki) which is always welcome. Loved it, I give it four snowflakes :snowflake::snowflake::snowflake::snowflake:
