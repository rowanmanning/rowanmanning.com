  * We had a deliberately relaxed week without too many plans, we're both quite tired.

  * I've been reading a lot for the last couple of weeks and I'm on track with my very unimpressive 12-books-in-a-year target. I read Frankenstein, which I enjoyed a lot, and have moved on to Dracula which is great so far. I didn't _mean_ to end up in "classic horror fiction 2024" but here we are. I might try the Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde next.

  * On Tuesday I went to [Alice's birthday drinks](https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/weaknotes-290) and drank quite a few cocktails. It was fun! I didn't need to stay as late as I did but the company was good. Wednesday wasn't so fun.

  * In house news, we have lights again! Just not in the bathroom. Shah, the local man I'm paying to be my electrician/gas engineer/friend, will fit a new bathroom light soon :relaxed: it's been over a month of no big lights and the novelty of having them back is great.

  * On Saturday, Charlotte and I decided to have a day of shopping and wine. We visited [The Humble Grape](https://www.humblegrape.co.uk/) a short walk away and had a little wine flight and some cheese. It was so nice. On Sunday we went to [Humble Crumble](https://www.humble-crumble.com/) to complete our Humble Weekend.

  * In tiny lad news, they're just so excellent. Tom Barnaby, who is more shy than Douglas Fir, has finally decided that cuddling up to us and purring is a great way to spend his time. Just two purring lads who live with us.
