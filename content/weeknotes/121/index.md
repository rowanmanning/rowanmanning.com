    title: "A tray of halloumi and chickpea bake with the halloumi cut into heart shapes"

  * This week it was Charlotte's turn to be sick; I think I must have given her my gross cold. She's been very snotty, poor girl.

    Tuesday was [Heart-Shaped Food Day](/weeknotes/69/). I wasn't feeling particularly great so I just made one of our [regular easy weekday meals](https://www.sainsburysmagazine.co.uk/recipes/mains/smoky-halloumi-bake) but cut all the vegetables and halloumi into little hearts.

  * On Wednesday we pulled back the carpet in the bedroom to make way for the wardrobe delivery. I think the floorboards under there are pretty nice! We might end up sanding and varnishing them instead of replacing the carpet :eyes:

  * Our bedroom is not our bedroom now, just for a week. Apparently, it's gonna take four days to fit the wardrobes and I'm gonna have to give up on the office again for a week because of it.

  * I played [Power Grid](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2651/power-grid) with my board game group for the first time in ages! I came second last but I forgot how fun a game it is :blush:

  * On Friday we went to Gallal and Euan's for some food and a few drinks. I really need to never have [Dr Pepper](/weeknotes/112/) again â€“ it fucks me up big-time, luckily I only had one as my last drink.

  * Over the weekend we got the train down to Faversham where Charlotte's mum was stage-crew in a pantomime. Pantomimes are as bad/good as I remember them (it's been a long time).
