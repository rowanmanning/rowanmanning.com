  * I set up a new mortgage as my current rate expires later this year. It's not ideal to be paying ~Â£350 more per month :grimacing: really wish I'd gone with a 5-year fixed term back when I could get a 2.79% interest rate.

  * On Thursday we saw Charlotte's brother, who's back from Iraq for a few weeks, as well as the rest of her London-based family. It was nice to catch up.

  * We booked annual leave for our trips to Japan, Australia, and the Philippines later in the year. I'm gonna be off for a _lot_ of Q4 but I'm super excited for it all!

  * We took Friday off work and headed up to Birmingham to stay with Ari and Chibs, who recently moved into a _massive_ house slightly out of town. We had basically an entire wing to ourselves.

    We mostly chilled out and chatted but went to [Godiva Festival](https://www.godivafestival.com/) in Coventry on the Saturday. It was lots of fun, I felt very old until we found the place where all the other adults were hanging out. I got a little bit sunburnt like an idiot.

  * I created a [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org/) (a federated link aggregation/discussion platform) account after going cold turkey on Reddit a few weeks ago. I was never a super frequent user but I was missing a place to endlessly scroll through memes and bad takes. Lemmy has been great for that so far and it's growing loads while Reddit semi-implodes.

  * The more goes on with the major/VC-backed social networks the more I'm convinced that I'll never hand my data over to one again (including BlueSky in that definition).

  * I've been obsessed with Padam Padam by Kylie for a couple of weeks. I can't get it out of my head, and why would I want to?
