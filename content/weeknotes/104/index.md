  * It's been a busy and very tiring week ðŸ˜´ gonna keep this one short because I want to just go to bed tbh.

  * On Thursday we went to [Immersive Gamebox](https://immersivegamebox.com/) to play Squid Game, it was fun. Far too easy to accidentally lean on the wall and push buttons though.

  * On Friday I recaptured some youth at my first gig since before Covid. We went to see Sum 41 at Ally Pally. It was a lot of fun! Though we all realised that we know about four songs of theirs.

  * We took a horrific packed and hungover train up to Birmingham for the weekend for James' 40th birthday. It was so great seeing everyone and I perked up after a few drinks.

  * OK, I'm going to watch some Love is Blind in bed now, byee :wave:
