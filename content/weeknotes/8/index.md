  * What even is time? I'm very firmly in holiday mode, where I've forgotten what day of the week it is and I have no routine. The only constant is Tootsie waking me up at 7:30 to be fed and Tootsie meowing to be given his dinner.

  * So [Christmas is cancelled](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-55379220). We have a lot of food already as we were planning to have Christmas day with some friends, which we can't do now, I guess we'll be eating leftovers for a while! I'm still excited for our first Christmas not going to either of our families â€“ we can do things the way we want at the pace we want and that sounds delightful. Nobody can judge us for opening champagne at 8am ðŸ¥‚ (Aldi, naturally).

  * I've been staying away from coding a bit over the last week to moderate my pace and not burn out. The small bits I did get done are integration tests for [Audrey](https://github.com/rowanmanning/audrey#readme). I love writing tests, I get more satisfaction from them than any other aspect of programming â€“ nothing beats the warm secure blanket of `>90%` coverage and a cascade of green ticks.

  * Wasn't that nice?

  * Oh I did do one more thing, I made [Yeehaw](https://github.com/rowanmanning/yeehaw#readme) give all horses Christmas names for December. It was [a small job](https://github.com/rowanmanning/yeehaw/commit/fffe03eb651ea7a724b83363814bc4f3634c1477) which will bring me a lot of joy. My favourite horses so far have been Merry Firewood, Jolly Chimney, and Bethlehem Vixen.

  * I had a lovely chat with Becky (my sister), it's been ages since we caught up and it's so weird that I've only seen her once, maybe twice this year. We laughed a lot and I didn't realise how much I needed it.

  * There's just been too much TV, I feel like a bit of a zombie. I'm _loving_ His Dark Materials and getting some strong nostalgia from reading the books as a kid. But we've also been watching a _lot_ of cooking shows (maybe too many cooking shows):
  
    * MasterChef: The Professionals is a fixture, I really want Monica Galetti to tell me nice things about my food.
    
    * Snackmasters is such a good concept and a lot of fun, but I find the presenter really annoying.

    * Great British Menu, Christmas has felt much nicer than the regular show, Andi Oliver is great as a presenter.

    * Love Bites (on ITV2) should be a guilty pleasure but I'm not guilty about it. It's very cringey watching people in their early 20s try to impress each other, _especially_ when they're trying to do it by cooking things they have no clue how to make.

  * OK I think I won't write anything until after Christmas now! I hope you enjoy the festive period despite everything that's going on :wave:
