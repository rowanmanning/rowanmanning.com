  * I lied, I'm absolutely gonna try and write weeknotes [via VS Code](https://vscode.dev/) in my mobile browser. Apologies in advance for any typos.

  * Costa Rica is beautiful. We stayed in Liberia for a few nights and then moved to a small resort near Rinc√≥n de la Vieja volcano. We're off to La Fortuna for a few days next.

  * The mornings are super hot and sunny and there's heavy rain and thunder in the afternoon. We've been soaked through a few times.

  * Ziplining was a lot of fun, cocktails sat in hot springs was lovely, and all the food we've eaten is amazing.

  * Hummingbirds and geckos are everywhere here, we managed to not get bitten by bullet ants or the many other interesting-looking bugs. Cicadas are ridiculously noisy.

  * Everyone is very friendly and willing to put up with how little Spanish we all know. Pura Vida!
