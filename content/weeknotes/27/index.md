  * I finished the first draft of my blog post about the [virtual treasure hunt](https://rowanmanning.com/weeknotes/20/) that [Glynn](https://twitter.com/glynnphillips) and I ran. Hopefully, with some feedback, it'll be published in the next week or so. I'm mostly pleased I got a draft finished – I'd definitely been procrastinating to avoid it.

    It was Tootsie's birthday this week. We use his date of adoption and we _think_ he's 6 now. We celebrated by buying him a toy he's not very interested in and making him a delicious cake that he inhaled.

  * It's been interesting to see Basecamp implode over the last week. These snowflake CEOs eh?

  * I'm still going strong on the crosswords, and I'm finally able to beat [Jenn](https://twitter.com/teachlearncode) _relatively_ regularly on the [NYT Mini](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords). I made a Slack channel at work to discuss clues and it feels like a nice little group.

  * I've been doing more socially, which is lovely but exhausting.
  
  * I caught up with [Andrew](https://adlawson.com/) and [Ed](https://twitter.com/Ed_Kend) in a pub garden. I found out that Andrew's partner is working on Bridgerton season 2 which has elevated her coolness by a lot tbh.

  * We went for a 10-mile walk with a few friends from Dover to Deal, I'm unfit, achy, and sun-kissed but very happy.

  * [Kara](https://ghost.computer/) started writing weeknotes which I'm pleased about – I'm not reading much else at the moment, little peeks into peoples' lives is currently more my speed than actual news.
