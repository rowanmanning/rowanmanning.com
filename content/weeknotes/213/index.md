  * It's been a nice week off, we didn't overdo it on the plans.

  * We spent two separate days visiting grandparents. I drove Alison's car properly for the first time and it's great - both sets of grandparents are pretty annoying/expensive by train and it made everything easy.

    This also meant that the lads went on their first big car journey up to see my grandma. They _kinda_ hated the journey up but they were quite relaxed once there and my grandma enjoyed meeting them. The way back they just slept the whole way :tada: they'd never experienced stairs before, they were fans.

  * [Alex W](https://alexwilson.tech/) is leaving the FT and the country. On Thursday I popped along to his super well-attended leaving drinks and had a great time. It was a parade of old faces.

  * Lovely news: we have another leak in the bathroom from upstairs. The light fitting has been flooded again, joy. I sent an uncharacteristically stern text to the leaseholder upstairs and he's been very apologetic and said he'll actually get the wider plumbing issues fixed this time. We'll see. I'll chase.

    Lovely to shower in the dark again.

  * On Saturday we went to Abba Voyage for Charlotte's mum's birthday! It was pretty good; the holograms are _excellent_ from a distance but I wish they wouldn't show you larger images of them on the screens â€“ _very_ uncanny valley and I kept catching myself watching them in horror instead of listening to the music. The live band was great!

  * On Sunday Alison cooked a roast, excellent, and we finished The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives. WILD.
