  * It's mostly been a quiet week because we were trying to not get COVID ahead of our weekend trip to Bordeaux. I kinda missed seeing people in the office for one of the days (especially as my new team member was in on Friday).

  * However, [we did catch up with Kara one evening](https://ghost.computer/posts/20) in a pub near our flat. We played [Subjective Guess Who](https://twitter.com/apaleslimghost/status/1501624454744522756) and we weren't the best at it.

    We flew to Bordeaux for the weekend, very pleased with ourselves for not catching COVID before the trip. The city is really beautiful and fun. We drank a lot of wine, did a short oenology workshop, ate a lot of food, and enjoyed occasionally being outside in just a T-shirt in the sun! The statues in Bordeaux are top-notch, check out this horse.

  * We started feeling suspiciously ill on the way back. For me, it vaguely felt like a hangover (which would be legitimate) but Charlotte got a runny nose. We did a test immediately when we got home :grimacing:

  * COVID has finally reached our household, I'm all clear for now but it's probably only a matter of time because the line on Charlotte's test looks like someone drew it on in thick Sharpie. Several hours after writing this I'm also feeling pretty rough :grimacing::grimacing::grimacing: there goes my theory that I'm super-immune.
