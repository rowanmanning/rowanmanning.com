  * I finally have an actual mortgage offer! I started applying [back in June](/weeknotes/33/). It's taken this long due to several failed attempts ([deck access](/weeknotes/35/)), some very inefficient people, and the lender checking all the fire safety docs _extremely_ fastidiously. I did a little dance around the flat when I heard.

  * Now my solicitor is being the blocker. They're being quite slow and it's looking a little unrealistic that we'll complete by the end of September. This doesn't impact me too much, but it will cost the sellers more in stamp duty on their next place :grimacing:

  * I bought some boxes! I'm a big fan of packing at a nice slow pace, far earlier than is really reasonable. Everything feels more real now, I can't wait to get out of this flat.

  * I timed my office trip this week to coincide with [Mel](https://twitter.com/Mellywellington) being there, and we had our first in-person mentoring session for around 18 months. Mel's an ace person and I've missed grabbing coffee with her.

  * My [crossword leaderboard](https://crossword.rowanmanning.com/) website is three months old, and several of us have managed to do the crossword solidly over that time (as evidenced by [our shiny three-month awards](https://crossword.rowanmanning.com/leaderboards/2021-09-18/)). If you're an FT person who likes crosswords then let me know!

  * We went for a meal to celebrate Charlotte's continued recovery, it was lovely to do something that feels normal. We've been slowly increasing the length of our walks to ease us both back in – we've been very lazy since the surgery.

  * I've been a professional software engineer for 13.7 years as of today! [Thanks Arjun for the reminder](https://twitter.com/adgad/status/1439482576553529347) – I forgot to add it to my calendar.

  * I'm getting a real hankering to play Minecraft again, and play a bit while I'm away and have more time. [The first 1.18 snapshot](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-21w37a) was released and the new caves and mountains look amazing.
