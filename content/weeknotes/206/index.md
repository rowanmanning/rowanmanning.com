    title: "Tom Barnaby walking along the top of a tall wall, contemplating how he's gonna get down"
---

  * Back to work, it took a while to get back into it tbh but got lots done at the end of the week. We're _really_ close to announcing rolling out a new tool that'll really reduce toil for our engineering teams. I'm excited about it.

  * On Thursday we did a little pub crawl from the office back to Whitechapel. There were a few jägerbombs involved and I regretted that decision on Friday. However Tim and I got 24/25 on the [Joe pub quiz](https://www.joe.co.uk/quizzes) despite neither of us being at full health.

  * Saturday was very nice. I got a load of jobs done then Charlotte and I went for a meal then for cocktails. We tried out [Eve Bar](https://www.evebar.co.uk/) which was _amazing_, not exaggerating when I say they might be the best cocktails I've ever had. We even spotted Adam Handling having some post-work drinks. Tempted to try the tasting menu at Frog upstairs but it's edging towards the obscene end of expensive.

  * I finished [Dune Messiah](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44492285-dune-messiah) and picked up [Children of Dune](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44492286-children-of-dune) immediately afterwards. They are pretty excellent sci-fi and it's interesting spotting how much it's influenced more modern media. I think I'll have a break from Frank Herbert after this one though.

  * My board game group tried out [Terra Mystica](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/120677/terra-mystica) for the first time this week and I really liked it. We didn't quite finish the game due to running late but would definitely play it again now we know the rules.

  * Tom Barnaby has started a slightly worrying habit of getting onto this 8 foot wall and then struggling to find a way down.
