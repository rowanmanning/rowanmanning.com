  * I'm back from Wales, we extended the trip by a few days when we got an extra Bank Holiday. The extra few days out of London meant that we never got to witness [The Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queue).

  * Overall we walked about 50 miles across the Welsh countryside. A lot of footpaths were either ploughed, planted over, or guarded by angry farm dogs.

  * When you walk that much obviously you need to soak in the hot tub a lot too. It's important to rest your muscles, you know?

  * Adam found a severed porcelain doll's head on a bonfire by the farm. He named her Liz and she's _definitely_ cursed. We're probably all cursed now.

  * [starryai](https://www.starryai.com/) is quite good at generating haunted doll content.

  * We _always_ over-order food when we go away with a large group of friends. On the last full day, we played [Roll for Sandwich](https://www.polygon.com/23169570/roll-for-sandwich-interview) and managed to use up a lot of food in very weird sandwich combinations

  * The 8-hour trip home (broken cables on the line between Reading and Paddington) meant there wasn't really a nice gap between holiday and work. Let's see how this week goes!

  * My flat hasn't flooded, which is great.
