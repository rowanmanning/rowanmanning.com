  * I rebuilt this website in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) earlier in the week. It's been ages since I've done a significant amount of programming, and it was a lot of fun learning how to use something new. Hugo is super fast and super flexible. I also modernised [the CSS](https://github.com/rowanmanning/rowanmanning.com/tree/main/themes/rowanmanning/assets/sass) a lot and I didn't realise how much I've missed styling websites.

  * I read too much news this week (well, mostly I compulsively refreshed the FT's election coverage). Well done America!

  * I finally got around to playing [Gloomhaven](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174430/gloomhaven) again, my group has been consistently playing other games on Tabletop Simulator throughout the pandemic but we let Gloomhaven slide for most of the year.

  * We've been trying to cook more vegetarian and vegan food. I've always used the internet for recipes but recently we bought our first cookbook, [East by Meera Sodha](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0241387566/) â€“ we've tried loads of the recipes from it and _EVERYTHING TASTES SO GOOD_. One that we keep going back to is kimchi fried rice which I could eat pretty much every day.

  * We're locked down again. We didn't really do much leading up to it, but on Friday we did walk to borough market (which is all still open for takeaway). I got a cinnamon bun, which I've been really craving for weeks. I thought having one would fix the craving but now I want more.

  * Occasionally I get far too into a song and it's pretty much all I listen to for a week or more. Right now that song is Islands in the Stream by Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers. I think it might be that my subconscious mind is still sad we didn't get a Dolly Parton remix of Old Town Road.

    Charlotte has made several threats about what will happen if I keep singing it. I probably shouldn't push my luck now that we're less able to leave the house.
