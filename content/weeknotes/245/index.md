  * What even happened this week? It's been a blur, trying to drag my head back to normality temporarily.

  * We had our monthly Unite members meeting, growing steadily in attendance as we increase membership and people realise that stuff is _happening_ :tada: my focus on comms has paid dividends and we run a monthly newsletter now.

  * Otherwise it's been quite quiet, trying to prep for our next trip and make sure my team's work is covered while I'm away. Due to some staffing changes I will return to a much more pleasant and productive working environment.

  * I hurt my foot, lots of pain in my first metatarsophalangeal joint which means walking is _very_ annoying. Not even sure how it happened tbh but I definitely wasn't drunk this time. It's improved a lot but this is less than ideal ahead of a holiday where I expect to be out and about a bunch. Oh well, maybe I'll just lounge about while people fetch me things :shrug:

  * On Sunday we ticked off a few nearby recommendations, we went to [Satan's Whiskers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan's_Whiskers) with J&C for excellent cocktails which I think deserve the hype, I highly recommend it. Afterwards we had pizza at [Sodo](https://www.sodopizza.co.uk/) which is also _great_, easily one of the best pizzas I've had in London.

  * Our homegrown cat grass died so I went to buy some more seeds before realising you can just order it pregrown in a pot, far less waiting time and the lads are very happy.
