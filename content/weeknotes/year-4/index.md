Another year, another yearnote! 2024 was my fourth year of writing weeknotes and I've managed not to miss a week yet. Saying that, this yearnote is really late, we're already nearly two months into 2025 :sweat_smile: better late than never, eh?


## The Lads

This year has been dominated by two new additions to our household: Tom Barnaby and Douglas Fir. 26 of my 52 weeknotes for the year are [tagged with "kittens"](/tags/kittens/) and the year-in-thumbnails below is dominated by these two small lads.

Despite still not being sure if was ready after [Tootsie](/weeknotes/42/), I've had the best time seeing these two grow up. I couldn't have asked for two better-natured cats, I adore them.

We really didn't intend on getting kittens, we were going to rescue again but our hunt coincided with a friend of Charlotte's mum having an accidental litter. Two cats was also not the plan but they love hanging out and playing with each other - I'm so glad we took both of them.

Travel is now a little more complex and expensive as we need somebody to stop by and feed/play with them, but we haven't run out of volunteers yet. You'll note that we've done a lot less globetrotting this year, probably good for our carbon footprint.


## Reading

I started reading fiction again back in 2023 but it didn't stick. It was a different story in 2024, I read a total of 27 books which is probably more than the previous 5 years combined. I never had my nose out of a book as a kid and it's nice to rediscover this passtime properly. There have been some crackers, my standouts were:

  * [The Humans by Matt Haig](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18073307-the-humans) is funny and heartwrenching and introduced me to the author. I've been inhaling his other books and highly recommend him.

  * [The Devil and the Dark Water by Stuart Turton](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50632648-the-devil-and-the-dark-water) is a really excellent murder mystery with some nice supernatural themes, it was gripping. I'd already read The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle but this has cemented Stuart Turton as someone I'll always read.

  * [The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August by Claire North](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20055034-the-first-fifteen-lives-of-harry-august) has fun time-travel/time-loop elements and it's really exciting.

  * [Piranesi by Susanna Clarke](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48496334-piranesi) is beautiful and I couldn't put it down, the world really sucked me in and I finished it in just over a day. It's one I wish I could read again without knowing the story.

You can see my full list in [various notes in the "books" tag](/tags/books/) or on my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/96292269-rowan-manning).

Later in the year I got a bit stuck on the third book in the Dune series. I probably overdid it and need to not be scared of pausing and picking up something else to keep it going. I intend on reading about the same amount in 2025, probably mostly in sci-fi and fantasy again - reading is definitely about escape for me.


## Writing

Weeknotes have continued but they keep getting shorter. I only wrote ~15,000 words this year down from ~19,500. I'm writing them for myself so I've stopped pressuring myself to think of something interesting to go in; I've also stopped caring if there's no photo which is why there are fewer thumbnails this year.

Blogging, both on this website and at work, has taken a back seat too. Meh, who cares? I'll write about stuff if I feel the need to and I don't think my ability to hit flow state has suffered.

Something I noticed part way through this year is that the Grammarly plugin in my text editor had stopped working. It's possible that these are now more plagued with spelling/grammar errors. Again, I don't much care. The thing I probably _do_ miss is something telling me if I used the same word five times in rapid succession.


## What's happening in 2025?

After not really having much of a goal last year, I have a big one (for me) in 2025. I really need to start exercising again and improving my fitness, 40 is approaching and it's only gonna get harder. I'm not sure what this looks like yet. I hate the gym very much but I guess I probably need to suck that up a little. Maybe I'll start running again? Who knows, I'm just trying to hold myself accountable!

2025 might also include me deciding what I want the next step of my career to be. I know what it _isn't_ (management, stepping too far from production code) but I'm probably coasting just a little where I am at the moment. I'd still like to work at the FT, but I could maybe find some more challenging/broad work.

That's it, that was 2024! Thanks for continuing to read these :slight_smile:
