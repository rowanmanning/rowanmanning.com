  * It's been a quiet and lazy week which I think I needed.

  * At work, I've been replacing our eight-year-old Heroku-based monitoring systems with a suite of lambdas. It's going to cost considerably less to run. It's also going to be a lot easier to work with – far fewer dependencies, a _lot_ less boilerplate, and simpler code.

  * On Thursday we had a first visit from the contractors that work for our building insurer. He's a drying specialist?? We've been left with two very noisy industrial extractors to help dry out the walls and ceiling. The good news is, because the leak happened _in March_, we should only need them for a week. There's no lingering dampness that he was concerned about :relieved:

    The lads are warm and they're finding innovative ways to deal with it. Douglas Fir has worked out he can jump up and sit on the frame of the open windows to get a little breeze. Tom Barnaby hasn't managed it successfully yet.

  * I said I wouldn't because the producers have been getting desperate and more exploitative in recent seasons of Netflix shows, but we started watching Love is Blind UK. It's still wild as a premise. All of them seem _slightly_ more normal aside from the walking red flag that is Sam.

  * We're off to Malvern for a couple of days now, having Monday–Wednesday off work. We're going to do a lot of walking in the hills. Charlotte's brother and his girlfriend are looking after the cats which is lovely of them.
