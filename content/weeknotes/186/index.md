  * This week Tom Barnaby and Douglas Fir had the snip, poor lads, and got microchipped. We want them to be outdoor cats and this is the last step. Their regular vet doesn't have a surgery so we had to travel out to Hampstead, they were fine on the tube again.

    The lads _absolutely hated_ the vet-supplied plastic cones and, on night one, we had a shit incident – Douglas Fir went for a poo then tried to sniff it, getting a large lump caught on the cone and trailing it around a bit. The cones came off and I stayed up all night to make sure they didn't lick their wounds too much. The next day I primed two soft cones and they were transformed into two beautiful little sunflowers :sunflower::sunflower:

  * Because the vet was so far away and the cats had to be in for observation for a while, we took the day off and spent it wandering around Hampstead Heath. We pretty much just moved from bench to bench in the sun and read our books, it was a lovely way to spend a day.

  * I'm reading still. Dune was excellent, loved it, and I quickly picked up [Red Side Story](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199353348-red-side-story) by Jasper Fforde – a sequel I've been waiting 15 years for. It was fun and playful and I enjoyed it a lot. I started, and just finished, [Doomsday Book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24983.Doomsday_Book) which was also great. I barely put it down. I'm slowly getting back to the reading rate of my teenage self, I'm on 11/12 and realising my target for the year was a bit low.

  * On Saturday we went to Georgie's for a house party, it's been ages since I've been to one and I forgot how easy it is to get absolutely hammered when there are no time cues and you're free-pouring all your drinks. I had a great time, I think, but Sunday was ruinous.
