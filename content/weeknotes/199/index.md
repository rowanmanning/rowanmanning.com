    We were in Great Malvern from Sunday until Wednesday, and most of our time was spent doing long walks across the hills in slightly too-hot weather. It was a lovely time and it felt great to be out in the countryside. You're never super far from a tea room or pub in the Malvern Hills. We still managed about 20 miles over three days despite the heat.

  * We were _very_ pleasantly surprised to pay £4.20 for two drinks in the Wetherspoons there. It's like going back in time! Yes yes, Wetherspoons is bad etc but _£2.10 a pint!?_ I would not be surprised to pay double that for a single drink near work.

  * It was a delightfully short week at work. Sod the four-day work week, I could get used to two-day weeks.

  * On Saturday we attended not one but _two_ parties. Did you know that we're so sociable and young and in demand as party attendees? The first was Tammy's mum's birthday, lovely. The second was a big house party, there was a smoke machine and lasers, it was fun. I miss house parties.

  * The Insurance company keeps sending people to look at our flat. The drying is done (phew) and now we need to choose paint colours for the hall, bathroom, and kitchen. This might take us some time – we still have several years' worth of paint samples on the bedroom walls :grimacing:

  * I'm pleased they don't have to rip out all the plaster or rewire lots of things :relieved:

  * I finished [Base Notes by Lara Elena Donnelly](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58100591-base-notes) and really enjoyed it but definitely couldn't handle reading it at pace. It gripped me more toward the end though! Then I picked up [Piranesi by Susanna Clarke](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50202953-piranesi) and literally couldn't put it down; I finished it in about a day and a half. Beautiful worldbuilding IMO.
