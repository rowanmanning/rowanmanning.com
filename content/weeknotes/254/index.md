  * We're up in Staffordshire for a couple of weeks, working part time and enjoying being in the countryside. It's been a good balance and I'm feeling quite happy and relaxed up here.

  * The internet has been good enough for video calls which was our only work worry!

    We've walked over to Thor's Cave multiple times; from here you can head in either direction along the Manifold Valley and stop off at pubs or tea rooms.

  * You can tell we're not used to living in the middle of nowhere because we did three separate 30 minute drives to the nearest town to do shopping. I think we're into the swing of things now but it's definitely _different_ not having a shop right around the corner.

  * J&C came to stay for a few days before the weekend which was nice, we had wine and visited Alton Towers in absolutely torrential rain. Despite rides closing constantly we managed to get on all the rollercoasters we wanted! Waterproof trousers are a revelation.

    On Saturday we picked up Ari from Stoke and walked along The Roaches, one of the best walks I think I've done in the UK. Not too difficult with some excellent views along the way. The most fun part was the initial scramble up to Hen Cloud.

    A packed lunch at the top and a scone afterwards felt very wholesome.

  * Wetton, the village we're staying in, at least has a pub and a tea room that are open _kind_ of when they want to be from what I can tell. Both are great and means we have a lazy option if we can't be bothered with lunch or dinner.

  * The lads seem to be enjoying themselves. All normal behaviour and they're both cuddly and chill.
