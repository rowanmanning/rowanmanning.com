    title: "Six bowls of baked beans, all slightly different colours, looking very unappetising"
---

  * Tuesday drinks again because it was sunny and Emma's out of the country for a few months. A shandy in the sun is a beautiful thing, the sunny socials remind me why I love living in London. Both of my office days this week were without a coat, it's so freeing :heart:

  * I've been working with AWS CloudWatch RUM a bit lately. It's quite good. I think I'm already the authority on how it works :thumbs_up: Gonna build some tooling around it which will be fun and allow us to roll this out to teams quickly and effectively, giving us better visibility of client-side errors. IMO it's a really excellent idea to have a team dedicated to site reliability.

  * I took a very last-minute day off on Friday to go and visit Grandma who's still in hospital. She has carpal tunnel in both hands and is waiting for surgery on a heart valve, all very worrying for a 91 year old but I'm glad I visited and trying to stay positive. She's still in good spirits despite being a little bored, we went for a coffee and did a crossword together. The staff at L&D are wonderful.

  * Our main Saturday plan, a treasure hunt, was cancelled due to injury (not ours). We went for lunch with Charlotte's mum instead and regretted being near Tottenham Court Road.

  * On Sunday we popped over to Alison's to help with some DIY stuff. A washing line, bathroom lock, mirror, and (with help from a local dad) long curtain pole went up. I finally reclaimed my drill which has been over there for about six months.

  * As a reward, we did a taste test of 6 new baked bean flavours from Heinz, stocked in our local Iceland. It's a mixed bag. My ranking from best to worst was: Peri Peri, Tikka, BBQ, Chilli, Cheese, and Jalfrezi. Don't they look appetising?
