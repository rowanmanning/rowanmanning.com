  * I'm still very sad about [Tootsie](/weeknotes/42/) and probably will be for the foreseeable, thanks for all your kind words :heart:
  
  * We still need to settle the ridiculous vet bills that came with the end of his uninsurable illness :grimacing: very thankful that we have a healthcare system for humans at least.

  * Speaking of the healthcare system, Charlotte had a (routine) surgery this week. She's fine but still mostly bed-ridden so a lot of my time is spent looking after her, which is quite nice so far tbh. The only place I'm useless is changing dressings – I'm _really_ not very good with blood and/or wounds. My skin is crawling just thinking about it.

  * We've been watching a lot of TV which is all that's really manageable for Charlotte. We binged the first season of Bones and are onto the second. We also started season 2 of The Circle, which is obviously excellent.

  * This whole thing has made us want to move all the sooner, I hate our current flat even more now that Toots isn't in it. Things are still going at a snail's pace with my [flat purchase](/tags/house/) and I'm spending far too much time chasing both my solicitor and mortgage broker.

  * In the spare moments I do have, I'm very much getting back into {{< abbr "Dungeons & Dragons" >}}D&amp;D{{< /abbr >}} and have spent most of my free time doing some planning and worldbuilding for the couple of groups that I {{< abbr "Dungeon Master" >}}Dungeon Master{{< /abbr >}} for. It's such nice escapism.
  
    I've also been drawing a lot as part of this, mostly maps of nearby towns that my players are likely to visit. These aren't as detailed as some of my [older maps](https://kanka.io/en/campaign/10848/maps/21623/explore) but I'm still pleased with them. You can click these for interactive versions:
