  * It was a very social week. Lovely, but it really ate into my Factorio time.

  * On Monday we got some work news that had a negative impact on my productivity. It's _fine_, our jobs are _fine_ etc, but my advice (as ever) is to join a union. Join a union, my dudes.

  * In more positive news we've merged 400 dependency bump pull requests with no intervention from a human :chart_with_upwards_trend: one of the projects I'm most proud of in my time at this company because it reduces a lot of toil for our engineers.

  * Tuesday was Ako's leaving drinks before he went off travelling. A nice time :+1:

  * On Wednesday I met up with Andrew & Ed, where does the time go? We had a few drinks, talked about sad news, and got dinner. We talked about Factorio.

  * On Thursday I went out after work, the usual. It wasn't too late because I'd already been out twice in the week so far.

    On Friday we popped over to J&C's to watch some fireworks from their balcony. They have a great view of Alexandra Palace. Riley doesn't care about fireworks. Neither do the lads.

  * On Saturday I rounded off my five-days-in-a-row drinking with a housewarming at Alison's new place. I nearly fell asleep, it's been a long week.

  * We're back on the Vitamin D, lxds.

  * [It's a Wonderful World arrived](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/271324/its-a-wonderful-world), plus expansion. We haven't played it yet, this week maybe? It'll be the first time we try playing a board game with the cats, it may not work out.
