  * I had the week off, and I'm feeling rested. I naturally wake up and go to bed really late â€“ my brain works better in the evening. It's going to be hard switching back to waking up earlier :grimacing:

  * My house move looks to be progressing! Fixing the cladding is underway, and also the new {{< abbr "Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors" >}}RICS{{< /abbr >}} guidance means that I should be able to apply for a mortgage anyway, as this building shouldn't need an EWS1 form. I'm doing this, it's exciting!

  * We forgot how to cook because we've ordered food or eaten out far too many times this week. We've had five pizzas this week. That's too many pizzas.

  * We met up with Jennifer, Chris, and Luke at [HOSB](https://hosb.org.uk/) (members club but profits go to the homeless so I didn't feel gross being there). It was lovely seeing people, we're trying to plan a trip away, and aligning calendars for the summer is already a pain in the ass.

  * I've spent nearly 20 hours on Assassins Creed so far. When did it become normal for games to tell you how much time you've wasted in them? I don't want to know.

  * I've been writing weeknotes for half a year now! I'm pleased with myself for keeping it up. Some weeks are dull but there's always _something_ to write.

  * I'm not looking forward to being back at work, feeling some Sunday dread. I like my job on balance, but would rather not have one right now. I'm sure I'll be fine after a day or two back.
