  * I turned 35 this week. I wasn't feeling up to celebrating much so we ordered pizza and had a chilled evening. I haven't really been feeling the January birthday for the last couple of years.

  * Charlotte baked me an excellent lemon and mascarpone swiss roll. It was perfect and I ate an awful lot of it.

  * My brother came over with my niece on short notice, it was a flying visit but it's always lovely to see her. She turned one year old a couple of days before my birthday and is walking all over the place now. She likes dice a lot, maybe a future D&D player?

  * On Friday at work I joined in on our annual [Goose Chase](https://www.goosechase.com/), rushing around London between St Pauls and Farringdon to find clues and complete missions, ending in a pub for drinks and food. Our team came first! It was amazing and well-organised, exactly the kind of fun I enjoy.
