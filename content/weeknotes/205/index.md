  * The place we were staying this week was on the [Tarn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarn_(river)) and the river dominated the week overall. We spent most of our time by it, on it, or driving the length of it.

  * It's a really beautiful part of the world, lots of quaint little villages that I couldn't live in but enjoyed holidaying in. The roads are tiny and very windy but there were barely any other people driving so it was fine.

    We did some kayaking along the river. Our accommodation was between two dams so it was basically a lake – fairly easy paddling. We also swam but it was a bit cold.

  * We spent a little time in Lincou, Brousse-le-Château, Millau, Saint-Affrique, Réquista, and Plaisance. Every restaurant we tried was excellent. Every cake I tried was excellent. All the cheese I tried was excellent.

  * We did touristy things like going to look at some dinosaur footprints and viewing the Millau Viaduct from every possible angle. It's the tallest bridge in the world if you measure it in the correct way.

  * On the drive back to Toulouse we visited Albi again, this time for longer and to do a tour in the little road train. It's a really lovely town and I'd go back for a proper stay, we didn't have time for the Toulouse-Lautrec museum.

  * I'm glad to be home, the lads are pleased to see us and have been extra cuddly :heart:

  * It's been a nice quiet weekend apart from going for a few drinks for Luke's birthday. It was nice but I'm glad we didn't do a late one.

  * Fun news this evening: another leak from upstairs _just_ after we got all the insurance work done. It's not a big one but it's in an exciting new place above our bed. This is the fifth leak, the fourth caused directly by my upstairs neighbour's shoddy plumbing. They turned the heating on and apparently the radiators can't quite cope with that :facepalm:
