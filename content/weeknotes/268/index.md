  * I was in the office on Monday this week for a team lunch. We spent ~2 hours eating pizza and it was a delight.

  * Work Christmas Party #2 was on Tuesday and I had a fairly average time. It was very quiet, I think a lot of people are sick / couldn't be bothered. I ate and drank plenty and didn't really need the morning off that I'd booked.

  * I've been doing yet more D&D planning, I have more than I need for a couple of sessions and I have six players in the process of creating characters. I'm excited to get started again in January! Somebody needs to stop me from buying more beautiful dice sets.

  * On Friday we took a half day to head up to Birmingham to set up for our replacement Champagne Show. The original event we've been to [a](/weeknotes/53/) [few](/weeknotes/106/) [times](/weeknotes/161) has changed and is now lots of events over a month instead of the one excellent tasting. We decided to host our own instead.

    Each person brought a bottle with them and a food pairing then presented their drink with tasting notes in our newly aquired embroidered apron. It was a lot of fun!

  * After a slightly hungover train journey back, we had a chilled Sunday and spent a lot of the day just lounging in bed. We binged season 2 of [Nobody Wants This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobody_Wants_This) – silly and heartwarming, enjoyed.
