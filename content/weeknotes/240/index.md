  * I love a short week, let's also do a short weeknote.

  * We drove up to just outside Birmingham on Friday and spent the weekend with Charlotte's uni friends. We had a great time catching up, drinking, and enjoying the hot tub. It felt effortless and relaxing.

  * On Sunday we went for a little walk to a nearby brewery, then back for mexican food and more hot tub.

  * The Airbnb came with a very friendly cat named Kevin and a good amount of weird taxidermy.
