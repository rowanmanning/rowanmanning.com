  * It feels like a super busy week, I haven't really had time to stop and think!

  * On Tuesday I went into the office because [The Edit](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/ft-edit/id1574510369) team were having drinks and some of our South American engineers were in London. It was fun, and It was great to hang out with [Alice](https://alicebartlett.co.uk/) in the pub for the first time in _many_ years

  * I finished [All That's Left in the World](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/58329296) and loved it, weirdly heartwarming for an apocalypse. I fancy some Sci-Fi so I'm gonna give [Children of Time](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/25499718) a go

  * On Thursday we had most of the team in the office, it was great! I'm worried that I :sparkles:manifested:sparkles: FT.com completely falling over. We had Justine on our team for the day to shadow because her apprenticeship requires some experience with issue triage and incidents. I joked in standup that "oh I hope something serious goes wrong while you're here" and then it did an hour later

  * I really enjoy incidents

  * Over the weekend I went up to Leeds with Eric, Carlton, and Euan. We were visiting Scott who moved up there a few years ago. It was lovely to have the whole board game group in one place

    Scott and Lowri's cat is adorable. Just look at her angry little face :sob: I think I want a cat again

  * We played [Terraforming Mars](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/167791/terraforming-mars) which is a group favourite and [The Quacks of Quedlinburg](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244521/quacks-quedlinburg) is a lot of fun

  * On Saturday evening we went out in Leeds. We ended up in a questionable bar but 6 Apple Sourz for Â£9 is a great deal
