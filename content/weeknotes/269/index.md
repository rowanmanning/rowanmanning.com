  * Short and sweet today, because I've intentionally done very little. We're packing everything for Christmas up in Hull and that's about it.

  * Way back on Monday we had a Die Hard quiz and then our annual watching of Die Hard. It was low key, felt impromptu again, and I enjoyed it.

  * The weekend was very quiet apart from a little bit of last-minute shopping and wrapping. We've been watching a lot of shit TV and lounging around with the lads.

  * I'm still having loads of fun doing D&D planning. Currently mapping out a not-strictly-necessary mile-wide city down to the street and building level, a ridiculous amount of work. Between mapping sessions I'm making sure there are plenty of NPCs and side scenarios to make the world feel alive.

  * That's it for me, see you after Christmas.
