  * It's been a nice week, starting with meeting [Anna](https://www.annashipman.co.uk/) and her kids for lunch. It was good to catch up! Lots changes but nothing really changes was my takeaway.

  * On Saturday we went for an _excellent_ BBQ at Tammy and Marcus' place, many many great side dishes were consumed and we had a few cocktails. The Corona Colada _tasted_ good but could definitely have done with a proper shake - floating lumps of coconut cream were offputting.

  * They introduced us to a fun new party game, [Herd Mentality](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/311322/herd-mentality) where the aim is to answer subjective questions the same way as the other players. I bought a copy because too many of our boardgames are long and serious.

  * On Sunday we had a wee bottomless brunch at The Dixon near Tower Bridge. Great food, great prosecco, and set in a fancy old courthouse. Would recommend. We headed back to ours with J&C and had a few more bottles of wine and some games.

  * I'm getting really close to completing Baldur's Gate III, which is an incredible game. I'm going to have to stop myself from starting again immediately with a different class / play style because it's that great. I'm just constantly impressed with the level of depth in the story and how much your choices can influence things in the world around you.
