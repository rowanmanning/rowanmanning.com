  * I'm on Islay staying in Port Ellen and it's _beautiful_. It's a really small town of ~800 people and everyone's very friendly. We're here with Charlotte's brother and his girlfriend.

  * We flew up to Glasgow on Thursday, picked up a car and drove to Stonefield Castle where we stayed for the night. We went for a short walk around the grounds and had an excellent dinner overlooking Loch Fyne. A few whiskies and then bed.

  * Friday was Charlotte's birthday, we caught the ferry over to Islay. On the journey we saw some dolphins leaping alongside the boat. A great birthday treat. Once there we went for a tour and tasting of Islay's only rum distillery to make up for the fact that the rest of the holiday was going to be quite whisky-focused. A little merrier we checked into our Airbnb and went for dinner and several drinks.

  * On Saturday we checked off one of my bucket list items - walking the three distilleries pathway from Port Ellen. We stopped off at Laphraoig, Lagavulin, and Ardbeg distilleries and had a few drams. The staff in the last one invited us to a 70s night. Everyone's very friendly and I'm so glad we decided to visit ([see distillery rankings below](#distillery-rankings)).

  * Today we switched up the pace and drove across _most_ of the island. We visited Bowmore, Bunnahabhain, and Port Charlotte with a few distillery stop-offs. They cater very well for drivers, bottling up my tasters for later.

  * I know it's easy to say this when you're in holiday mode, but I think I could actually live here. Tomorrow we'll be doing a long walk up Glas Bheinn and Beinn Bheigier, the highest point on the island, weather permitting.
