  * This week's been all about seeing people I haven't seen in a while.

  * [Maggie](https://twitter.com/mgr_allen) (who is one of my reports) was in London so we got to hang out in person a bit. Despite being fine with _mostly_ remote you can't beat getting together in the real world â€“ gossiping is a lot more fun, it's far easier to read people's faces, and you can wander to get a coffee instead of staring at your screen some more.

  * On Thursday, after work, I met up with [Scarlett](http://www.scarlettrebecca.co.uk/) and we went to a private view for her friend [Hester](https://www.hesterberry.co.uk/). I love the use of light in her paintings!

    We went for sushi and just had a generally lovely catchup. Living in rural Wales agrees with her a lot.

  * Charlotte's gone to Finland to see our friend Andy, who moved there earlier this year. I have a tiny bit of FOMO but no more annual leave to take. I _really_ need to buy the maximum amount next year.

  * I spent a stupid amount of time playing Minecraft on a new server with some friends. We're playing with [Create Mod 0.5](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) ([seems like it might be a yearly thing](/weeknotes/31/)), and it's _so much fun_. If I know you IRL and you fancy playing then give me a shout!

  * I also hired a car on Sunday and drove up to visit my family. One of my favourite things is to not tell my grandma that I'm visiting: her happy surprise to see me is the biggest dopamine hit. I played with my niece a lot (just the smiliest baby) and caught up with my mum and brothers. What a lovely day.

  * I started [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) and managed to beat last year's score (I only managed 3 days because I was so tired/busy). I'll probably lose interest but in the meantime, it's a fun little distraction.
