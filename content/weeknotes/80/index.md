  * Work was fun this week. I got [Reliability Kit](https://github.com/financial-Times/dotcom-reliability-kit), a new project I'm working on, to the point where we're ready to start building and releasing packages. Release Please is just so magical. This is my first time building and working on a monorepo and it feels great learning a load of new stuff every day. I find myself reading a lot more and actually caring about what's going on in tech.

    I set all our test coverage requirements to 100% :eyes: I read [this great article on the benefits of 100% coverage](https://medium.com/openclassrooms-product-design-and-engineering/the-real-benefit-of-100-code-coverage-b2f30393d659) last year and it makes so much sense to me. I think adding this requirement is _way_ harder the longer a project goes on, so let's whack it in at the start.

  * I've been playing around with [WorldEdit](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldedit) in Minecraft, designing some large terrain pieces which I want to build on our multiplayer server. I'm getting that itch again which means I'll probably spend half of my evenings playing again.

    I finally perfected my Wordle guess distribution. What a nice curve, eh?

  * On Friday we went for some drinks with Jenn for her birthday, it was a nice time! We played Pin the Hard Seltzer on the Jennifer and ate pizza, it was lovely.

    On the tube home, Gallal, Charlotte and I accidentally drank a bottle of wine between us which tipped us into "make bad decisions" mode. We stayed up drinking and chatting until 4:30 am :facepalm:

  * On Saturday we needed something gentle to watch and binge-watched all of [Heartstopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartstopper_(TV_series)). I loved it! It's really heartwarming and sweet, and a pretty low-on-trauma celebration of young queer romance. I think I need to buy the graphic novels. hard recommend.

  * On the opposite side of my media consumption, I'm off to the cinema now to watch Doctor Strange before someone spoils it for me.
