  * I felt rotten all week. I should start with the obligatory "it's not COVID", but it _was_ a pretty nasty cold. I still ended up working quite a lot because boredom crept up quickly and work took my mind off feeling shit. I probably should have just rested.

    I felt just about well enough for our long weekend plans. We hired a car and just drove, only booking our first night's stay and then seeing what happened. It was lovely. We did a lot of walking and eating, starting in the Peak District and ending up in Yorkshire near Harrogate.

  * After a ~3-hour drive and 1-hour train back home we had to quickly finish dismantling our IKEA wardrobes to make way for the painting and fitting happening over the next couple of weeks. I finally saw Gallal's new flat, went for a couple of beers, and I'm exhausted.

  * Have a great week, everyone :wave:
