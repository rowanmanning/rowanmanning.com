  * After ~24 hours of travel I'm back in the UK. Slightly sunburnt and exhausted, trying to ease myself back into work.

  * The lads were _delighted_ to see us: Tom Barnaby has been demanding a cuddle every hour or two and Douglas Fir has been adamant about sleeping on the bed. I'm pleased that they don't really sulk and demonstrate that they missed us so readily :sob:

  * We've had a quiet week apart from a little joint birthday picnic for Arjun and Gallal. We had a few drinks and snacks near Kings Cross and it was lovely.

  * I read Project Hail Mary on holiday and _really_ enjoyed it, might try The Martian next as I'm trying to ramp up my reading again after a very lazy few months.
