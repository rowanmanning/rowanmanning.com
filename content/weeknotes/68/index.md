    My new office chair arrived! Instead of just sucking up buying one myself, I spoke to occupational health at work and they were excellent. They quickly assessed that the dining chair I was using was the cause of some back problems and approved me expensing a chair :tada: so far it's a huge improvement and having a headrest is really encouraging me to sit properly.

  * Please excuse the messy desk and also the terrible cropping in the photo of my chair. I was scared by [this thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/amateuradam/status/1490394034900197388) and had to crop my bank card out of it.

  * On Thursday I went to Puttshack in Bank with a group of friends. The actual golfing was fun! I enjoyed nerding out about how the technology works, it's really slick, and I came second (after Jenn, who smashed everyone). What wasn't fun was being surrounded by drunk city boys :grimacing: probs the only downside to our office's proximity to the city.

  * I've had my first couple of challenges juggling my current role vs my previous role at work. While I'm working directly in a team, I'm supposed to be dropping most of my Principal Engineer responsibilities but:

    1. I got more involved than I probably should have in some tech strategy stuff. My excuse is that [I spent a bunch of time last year helping to define this piece of work](/weeknotes/40/) and I have a bunch of useful context.

    2. I maybe gave too much thought to the upcoming promotion round while pointing [Alex](https://alexwilson.tech/) to the right docs etc â€“ I ran the last two rounds and it's difficult not to have it in the back of my mind.

  * In my day-to-day work, I've had my first chance in a while to put together a new app. Our Platforms team has been doing an excellent job of improving our tooling and everything is going pretty smoothly.

  * No spoilers, but [Love is Blind](https://www.netflix.com/title/80996601) season 2 is _wild_. At least on a par with Season 1. I can't believe I have to wait for the next part of the series :grimacing: If you've watched up to episode 5 then let me know, I need more people to talk to about this.

  * On Saturday we went on a nice long walk near Beaconsfield and stopped off for food, I feel a bit unfit at the moment and need to start walking more. I keep meaning to start Couch to 5K, but so far haven't managed to prize myself away from the couch.
