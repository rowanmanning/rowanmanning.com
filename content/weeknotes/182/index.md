  * Our new hob got delivered this week but the fitters couldn't fit it because they'd need to switch the oven over to a standard plug to make it work and didn't seem to fancy it. It's becoming very boring not being able to cook a lot of things.

  * Our new cat sitter came to visit the small lads and they all got on well so feeling less stressed about leaving them for a week in May. They seem to get on well with nearly everyone who visits which is nice.

    I need to maybe have a small break from Thursday pub after work because I keep staying out quite late and feeling quite hungover on Fridays. New pub new Jägerbomb format, who knew these split glasses existed!?

  * I watched all of Fallout over the weekend, not groundbreaking but I enjoyed it a lot – I think it was a good representation of the world in the games and it was fun.

  * I've started doing Sudoku again, picking up where I left off with the [Cracking The Cryptic](https://crackingthecryptic.com/) app and trying to remember all the solving techniques. It's a nice way to burn time.

  * On Saturday we went for a bottomless brunch with Tammy, Alison, and Marcus for the first time in _ages_. Afterward, we played on arcade machines and then went to see Daniel Beddingfield in Soho House (one of our friends works there). Soho House people are very much _the worst_ and I was happy to leave.
