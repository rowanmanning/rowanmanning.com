  * Back to work again, and back to the office. It's _fine_ isn't it. Really, it's _fine_. Nice to see people again isn't it?

  * [My diet](/weeknotes/271/) has been surprisingly easy tbh (yes it's early days), and it's forcing me to be more creative with cooking. I made some pretty delicious spring rolls and a lot of what I've been eating is rice-based. I've discovered there's basically nothing I can eat out and I feel healthy :+1:

  * We picked up Blue Prince again properly and it continues to be really fun and surprise us. Honestly I can't recommend this game enough.

  * On Saturday we met up with Tammy and Marcus for a treasure hunt around Soho. It was too easy but still fun.

  * On Sunday we went mudlarking with Alison and it was loads of fun! It was down in Wapping and we found a lot of Victorian and Georgian pottery with a couple of potential medieval fragments. The woman in charge was enthusiastic and made it fun, I'd go again!
