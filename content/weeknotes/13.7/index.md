  * Did you know that 21:36 on the 29th January 2021 marks 13.7 weeks since I started writing weeknotes?

  * The audience for this bonus content is a very small but dedicated group of people who are [_definitely_ not members of a cult](https://www.thegadhian.com/posts/signs-you-have-started-a-cult/).

  * In these troubling and slightly boring pandemic times, it's difficult to explain the level of excitement I feel when I see `13.7`, `137`, or `1.37` in the wild.

  * These numbers appear _so_ often when you're looking for them.

  * You should keep an eye out for these numbers too.

  * Really.
