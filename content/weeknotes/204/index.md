  * This week we met a new cat sitter who lives nearby and introduced her to the lads. I'm pleased they're generally not scared of strangers once they have a few minutes (or treats). They're now getting on well with her, following her between rooms and being their normal selves from what I can tell.

  * We needed a cat sitter because we're in France for a week, having a restful time. We flew into Toulouse and spent the night and morning there; I had one of the best omlettes of my life at brunch with Luke's mum who happened to be nearby.

  * After brunch we set off in the car. We had a brief stop-off in Albi to grab a coffee and look at a cathedral. It's a pretty town. No terrible driving mistakes so far, just a wrong turn or two. It's _normally_ harder to switch back to driving on the left once home.

    We arrived in Lincou (beautiful) where we're staying in a château. So begins my diet of cheese and bread. It's very picturesque, we're going to do several hikes, kayaking on the river, and drink plenty of wine.
    
    I slept most of today because we overdid it a bit on the first night :grimacing: probably needed the rest though tbh. I was feeling burnout creeping up on me towards the end of the work week.
