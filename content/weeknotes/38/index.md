  * I'm still pretty exhausted. We did very little this week â€“ we're being a little more careful after our COVID scare and isolation. We _really_ don't want to have to cancel our trip to Scotland in August :grimacing_face:

  * What I _did_ do was go and visit my family for my grandma's birthday, the first time we've been out of London in a while. The weather held up and it was such a nice change of pace spending the day relaxing in her garden.

  * Every summer the Product & Tech department at the FT play rounders in Regents Park, it's a lot of fun and it's back this year! We're going to spectate and I'm really excited to see some friends in person. I'll hopefully get to meet a bunch of the people who have joined since Lockdown too.

  * I'm still coding a lot in my spare time, slowly turning this website into a reusable [Hugo theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/). I think I'm just doing stuff for the sake of it, like maybe adding integration tests to your personal website is a bit much?

  * I committed actual money to my flat purchase for searches, things are finally happening! I first viewed this place four months ago which feels like forever.

  * The closer I get to buying a flat, the more I hate the one I'm living in. By the time we move it'll have no redeeming features in my eyes.

  * I'm melting.
