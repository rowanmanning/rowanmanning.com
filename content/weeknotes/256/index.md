  * Back in London and there's not a nice walk from my doorstep which is sad. You know what there is though? An abundance of takeaway food and internet that's good enough for me to play Crusader Kings III on. We're back, baby.

  * The Cornish people have reclaimed the empire of Brittania and I'm slowly getting rid of all that nasty Anglo-Saxon culture :+1: The richest and most developed cities in the world are Constantinople, Rome, and Exeter.

  * Work's been fun, we had a Platforms day where all our platformy teams got together and talked about our similarities and shared challenges. We have a lot in common, surprise surprise, and will hopefully talk more in future.

  * Work change and gossip has really stepped up this week. I probably can't share anything but folks, some class A conspiracy move announcements and conspiracy theories dropped.

  * I've had a busy weekend. It's been a while since I was a little hungover on a Monday but here we are. We went to a pub quiz yesterday and got a bit carried away. Oops.
