  * I spent two days in the office this week and got to hang out with a lot of lovely people. I spent a bunch of time [collaborating on architecture diagrams](https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/weaknotes-158) for some future work – I think that this is where being in a shared physical space really works for me. Two days in the office is _exhausting_ though, I'm going to have to slowly build up to being in for longer periods.
  
  * We finally booked a countryside trip with some friends and will be staying in a big house later in September. I was originally going to work for some of it, but have treated myself to a full week off. I'm excited about having a break but rapidly running out of annual leave.

  * I signed and sent the contract and deed to my solicitor for the flat I'm buying. Technically we can't exchange yet because I'm still waiting for a formal mortgage offer (my broker thinks it should come through next week :fingers_crossed:). I guess I should be pleased that they're so fastidiously checking the fire safety documents.

  * We started watching American Horror Story. I'm not very good with horror, might be one to watch more slowly so there's recovery time between episodes.

  * We went for dinner, a show, and drinks with Tammy and I had a great time. Co&Ko was delicious (Korean small plates), and I got a little too enthusiastic with the drinking and having long chats with strangers.

  * I paid for the fun with a horrible hangover and finding out that someone stole my debit card and withdrew £400 :facepalm: I've been refunded with a slapped wrist from my bank. The kind Lloyds fraud division employee reminded me that it's important to be security-conscious and cover my pin when inebriated.

  * We rewatched all of Good Omens on our hangover day. I think it was even better on a second watch.
