  * Work Christmas Party #1 was on Tuesday and I had the _best_ time. It was at Lucky Voice and I had my doubts but it was great fun, having the main room and all the booths to ourselves meant there was a lot of variety. I didn't overdo it at all, I had a nice time, and I sang my little heart out.

  * I had the day off on Wednesday but I didn't really need it. It was still nice to have a long lazy day in bed and on the sofa.

  * On Friday I played board games in person with Charlotte's old group. We played [Ark Nova](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/342942/ark-nova) which is still easily in my number one spot. Having dinner and a few drinks in an office meeting room made me feel very nostalgic for our old {{< abbr "Dungeons & Dragons" >}}D&amp;D{{< /abbr >}} sessions.

  * Saturday was Christmas Pizza day. We had a few drinks at a Wetherspoons, went to a _really_ weird Christmas show thing in Waterloo, left that early, and had our Christmas Pizza at Rudy's. #1 Christmas Pizza so far, no notes.

  * On Sunday we had Luke and Alison round to do our final Christmas cake decoration with royal icing. I cooked a full Christmas dinner and it was excellent, I'm a semolina-on-roast-potatoes convert, they were perfect. We also watched a couple of new Christmas films, I highly recommend both [Champagne Problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne_Problems_(film)) and [Jingle Bell Heist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingle_Bell_Heist) which had more plot than I was expecting.
