  * Maybe I don't hate working as much as I thought, dragging my motivation back was _hard_ this time though. Now I'm having fun again which is a luxury.

  * I really love a pub crawl, especially when it's impromptu on a Friday and we end up very close to our house. There are some excellent pubs in Aldgate and we finally tried the £2 pint place. The pints were Stella but can you complain for £2?

  * Crusader Kings III was a terrible choice for "a game I can just put down". I'm obsessed and the game keeps surprising me in fun ways; for example Thomas Becket turned up in my court, wrote me a military journal with some nice stat boosts, and then promptly got murdered by one of my rogue aunts before I even had chance to take him to Canterbury. The great grandchild of my lowly starting character rules the empire of Britannia and I'm keeping myself busy by fighting the French and Irish – a problematic tradition for sure but they started it tbh. I'm going to become a history bore, I can tell.

    The lads are very needy at the moment which is cute, not complaining. We're taking them away on holiday with us soon, up to Alton, and I'm excited to see if they enjoy it.

  * Over the weekend we went to Tammy's mum's birthday again. Excellent food as always and we managed to avoid too many tequila shots.
