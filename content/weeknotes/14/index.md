  * It was my Birthday on Tuesday, I turned 33. I didn't make any plans, but ended up having a few nice chats with family. Charlotte baked me an _amazing_ lemon meringue pie which I ate most of over the course of the week.

  * On Friday we ended our dry and veggie January a little early for a bit of a birthday celebration. My digestive system didn't agree with the sudden switch back, but it was nice to have wine again.

    Tootsie is being extremely cuddly lately, he keeps climbing into bed and I'll wake up to him purring next to my head. Despite him occasionally being an asshole, I love this cat.

  * We watched all of Bridgerton over the weekend. It made me happy.

  * Work is super tiring at the moment. Rewarding but tiring. I'm exhausted but I have a few breaks coming up in February.

  * I've had the Two Point Hospital soundtrack in my head all week. It's weird to find myself humming very catchy elevator music while I make tea. [Go listen](https://soundcloud.com/user-928004952/sets/two-point-hospital-soundtrack).
