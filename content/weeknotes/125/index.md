  * On Monday we went to Gallal's for dinner, it's so nice having people nearby who we can just pop around and see or have food with. I've never really had that in London and it's lovely.

  * My board game group played [Clank!: Catacombs](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/365717/clank-catacombs) which is quite a fun little deck-building / dungeon-exploration game. I'd definitely give it another go, despite dying before I could escape.

  * I still haven't had [Sosmix](/weeknotes/124/), apologies to those who are eagerly awaiting news.

  * I started a new ~10% project at work outside of (but kind of related to) my day-to-day work. I'm investigating whether it'd be possible to standardise logging across our tech department and what that might look like. It's really fun writing a draft specification.

  * The big news this week is that we went to Skegness for a [Butlins 2000s Weekender](https://www.bigweekends.com/weekends/back-to-the-2000s). I was nervous and unsure what to expect, but it was SO MUCH FUN! Like sure it's full of stag and hen dos and a slightly unhealthy amount of drinking, but everyone was really nice and the music was great. The group of friends I was with all went at their own pace with a lot of respect for each other's time and space.

    Some highlights were: the bottomless brunch, a freezing sea swim, Gareth Gates, and [Symphonic Ibiza](https://www.symphonicibiza.com/).

    Someone has a video of me dancing on a chair, singing Uptown Girl, while swinging my jumper in the air :grimacing:

    Anyway, here's lovely Gareth who's definitely 100% reaching out to me.
