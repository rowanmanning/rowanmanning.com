  * I kinda forgot to mention in the relief that Grandma's surgery went well and she's back home now, doing a lot better. They had to put a balloon inside her artery which is risky for a 91 year old and it was playing on my mind.

  * Short week at work, still tiring. I'm on the edge of burnout which is why I booked a week off to rest - I kinda forgot to take any holiday so far this year and I can feel myself being annoyed by things far more easily. We're going to Rome for a few days and then I'm doing nothing in London for a few more. It's going to be great.

  * On Saturday we had a picnic in a park near home and invited a few people for drinks. It was a lovely day and we had a good turnout from all our Whitechapel friends. I love summer weather in London. We met Artem's dog who's tiny and very cute, big fan.

  * Tom Barnaby learned how to climb on top of the door, he's so clever :heart:
