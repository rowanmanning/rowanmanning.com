  * Oof a lot of incidents this week! Tiring but I think I'm good at making calls with this stuff and I don't really get stressed about them. "Nobody dies if the FT goes down" is my mantra. One of the issues was a pretty nasty {{< abbr "Cross-Site-Scripting" >}}XSS{{< /abbr >}} attack which was quite a fun one to fix.

  * We were also onboarding an engineer who's bootcamping with our team. By the end of week one he's contributed a decent amount and got a good taste of all the different work our team does :muscle:

  * Four days to go before some time off :tada: I'll be writing weeknotes from Tokyo this time next week!

  * On Friday we visited Tammy and Marcus and ordered almost every item from the Taco menu to share and rate. Turns out the tacos are the worst bit? It was a fun evening, we played [Priorities](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/345056/priorities) which is quite a fun party game, I might buy a copy.

  * Because we're away quite a lot over the next few months, we've been doing family visits. On Saturday we went to see Charlotte's nephew who's 3 months old now, he's very chill and very cute.

  * On Sunday my mum and brother popped over and we spent the whole day together. Lots of chatting, lots of eating, and a couple of games. It was lovely.

  * Later on Jenn came over and then refused to leave, which is why I'm writing these at 22:30. Rude :yellow_heart:
