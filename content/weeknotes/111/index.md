  * We had our main company Christmas party on Tuesday. It was fun, it's always a different vibe when there are hundreds of strangers from other parts of the business. I did some dancing. I managed not to embarrass myself â€“ I was able to actually work the next day.

  * You can tell I'm well and truly in Christmas mode because we did a bottomless brunch on Friday at Polo Bar which was loads of fun. I also managed to not be too hungover. Is this luck or restraint?

  * On Saturday we had some friends over to watch Christmas films. Luke came over earlyish and we watched a couple of films before Jenn & Chris arrived. Then we managed three more. I feel very festive.

    * [Christmas Under Wraps](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4180032/) was very compelling for a Hallmark Movie. A healthy dose of nepotism is the key plot point I think, but it also sticks to some key themes like "love interest is introduced wearing a check shirt".

    * [Christmas With You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_with_You_(film)) is a new-for-2022 Netflix film. It strays _slightly_ away from the royal themes of The Princess Switch et al, but not so far that we couldn't predict everything that was gonna happen. Enjoyed it a lot. Freddy Prince Junior does well playing "older but still hot dad".

    * [Falling for Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling_for_Christmas) is the new Linsay Lohan film that everyone's been talking about. I _enjoyed_ it and will watch it again but maybe I set my expectations too high. It did make me laugh a few times. Lindsay Lohan's face doesn't really move a lot nowadays. I had a bit of a crush on her back in The Parent Trap days. It's not weird, I was 10 years old.

    * [Angel Falls Christmas](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15978102/) was probably the flop of the evening. Every good Christmas film has some magic in it, _however_, I don't want that magic to be explained away with complex in-world lore. I want to be left guessing a little bit thanks.

    * [A Christmas Miracle for Daisy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16275882/), Another Hallmark, was fairly average but maybe we didn't do it justice because it was movie #5 and we were tired. The title does just say it all, over-specific, Hallmark is running out of name ideas.

  * I'm sick. It's very annoying, I have a hot and scratchy throat and I'm exhausted. Probs gonna take a day or two off to recover. At least it doesn't seem to be COVID.

  * Ooh, week 111 on the 11th.
