  * This week is all about the weekend again, with a pretty uneventful week.

  * The feedback [last weekend's bleakness](/weeknotes/127/) varied from [paraphrasing] "I love this, please can I come next time?" to "we mostly think similarly but then you go and do something weird like this". To each their own.

  * I don't look at the analytics for my website generally, but it turns out [divisive weekends drive views](https://app.usefathom.com/share/lzdrdpso/rowanmanning.com?from=2023-03-10+00%3A00%3A00&page=1&range=custom&sort=visitors%3Adesc&to=2023-04-10+23%3A59%3A59) (shout out to [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/ref/PM56BH) who do privacy-focused analytics that doesn't do anything creepy with the data).

  * In contrast to last week, for the four-day Easter weekend, we travelled up to the Lake District with some friends for a relaxing few days staying on a very pretty farm near Ullswater.

  * I'm really glad I didn't have to drive up, Marcus and Tammy drove the six hours :grimacing: (lots of bank holiday traffic).

  * Cumbria's always incredibly beautiful and worth the extra journey time.

  * On Saturday we did a ~9-mile walk and tackled 4 different [Wainrights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Wainwright) (Alison is trying to walk 30 of them this year). The walk was tough and boggy in places but a lot of fun. It was perfect walking weather, chilly with a bit of a breeze but warm in the sun :heart:

  * We spent the low-internet evenings playing board games. People really enjoyed [Railroad Ink](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/245654/railroad-ink-deep-blue-edition) so I'm glad we took it with us. We also played a lot of [Dobble](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/63268/spot-it) which is always incredibly stressful and breaks my brain.

  * Charlotte and I set up an easter egg hunt, very cute seeing our friends get excited and competitive about it.

  * Back to normality now. I'm gonna finish the weekend by going to see Dungeons & Dragons with the Whitechapel crew.
