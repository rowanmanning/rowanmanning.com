  * It felt like quite an uneventful week. I spent a fair bit of work time digging into our Grafana dashboards, which was fun.

    A lamp I bought on eBay got delivered, I love it. Soon the whole house will be free from the harsh glow of The Big Light.

  * We started watching season 3 of Too Hot to Handle. It's great trash. Unfortunately, [none of the contestants look like Simon Legg this year](/weeknotes/36/).

  * It's taken [since May](/weeknotes/30/) but I think I'm _finally_ getting the hang of [My City](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/295486/my-city). Over the last couple of games, I've gone from a very solid last place to a few points between me and first :tada:

  * I saw my uncle and aunt on Saturday, they came to see my flat and we went for some food nearby and a few drinks. It was actually lovely. I worked with this uncle as a kitchen fitter for a year between college and my first tech job and, as predicted, he spent a long time assessing the quality of my kitchen. We have good hinges apparently.

    On Sunday we walked from Whitstable to Faversham, a very flat and easy 9 miles with nice sea views. We met Charlotte's mum for dinner in Fav and felt very wholesome. We passed an antique shop and I bought another lamp, Charlotte thinks I have enough lamps now (I don't).
