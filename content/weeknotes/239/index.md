  * This week my boardgame group tried out [Heat: Pedal to the Metal](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/366013/heat-pedal-to-the-metal) which is a racing game with some great mechanics for engine overheating and corners. It's more strategic than I was expecting and I'd recommend it as a fun quick game.

  * I finished the Red Dead Redemption epilogue which could have been a little longer, a nice end to an exceptional game. I picked up Baldurs Gate III, my next in a long line of games I paid a lot of money for but then didn't play. I'm 7 hours in and I can tell this game is gonna keep me occupied for a while - I wonder if I'll beat my recent 434 hour Factorio playthrough.

  * Birthday drinks for J on Thursday after a few on the roof at work. Feels like summer is here doesn't it?

  * More birthday celebrations on Saturday for Charlotte's nephew who is two. He was jetlagged and wasn't really feeling it but we had a nice time regardless.

  * The lads met a local cat and there was a lengthy standoff before they chased it away. Well done boys, good yowling.
