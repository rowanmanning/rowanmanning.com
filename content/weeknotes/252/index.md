  * Earlier in the week my board game group met in person for the first time since Scott had a baby, always a great time. We completed level 12 of [The Mind](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244992/the-mind) which we didn't think was possible. We just got so in-sync and you can't beat the dopamine of placing an 8-card sequence :clap:

  * The highlight of this week was the long weekend. We went to [Camp Wildfire](https://campwildfire.co.uk/) for the first time with a few friends, it's advertised as "summer camp for adults" and we weren't _100%_ sure what to expect. It was _so much fun_ and we've already booked next year :sweat_smile:

  * OK it's quite intense but so much fun if you lean into the bits that seemed initially cringy to me, e.g. earning points for your chosen patrol (badgers, foxes, hawks, or squirrels). The website makes it look very much like it only caters for big extroverts, but there was loads to do and we all had a lot of fun. The day time is for booking activities and the night is for music, comedy, interesting talks, board games, and sports-day-like games.

    It was really friendly and welcoming. I chatted to a lot of people despite picking completely different activities to the rest of my group: axe skills, kintsugi pottery, geocaching, wood whittling, fire lighting, and a scavenger hunt, all set in beautiful woodland.

  * For me it was also an experiment to see if I can handle camping. Being dragged to a few festivals with my family as a teenager had kind of killed it for me, but I enjoyed it a lot and I'm kinda tempted to buy a tent and do it more over the summer. The excellent weather probably helped!

  * Anyway, despite having one of the most fun weekends I've had in years, I'm glad to be home, properly clean, and in a real bed.
