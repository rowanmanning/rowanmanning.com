  * The decorator came! We've had horrible stains on our ceilings and down our walls since MARCH and now everything's nice again :relaxed:

  * The insurers decided that they _weren't_ going to paint the kitchen but, due to them not telling the decorator this, he bought the paint anyway. He didn't care at all and gave us the paint so we can do that ourselves.

    This really got us in the mood to properly finish off all the decorating in the flat. Charlotte bought a nice new rug for the bedroom and we tried a bigger patch of a peachy colour that us and the cats have decided we don't like.

    I've literally _just_ realised that it's basically [FT Pink](https://aboutus.ft.com/company/ft-pink-130) and we don't need our bedroom to remind us of work.

    Boring, but we're going with a dark cream that we already have just to get it done for now. It'll be nicer than the very patchy current walls.

  * My board game group played Wingspan and I killed it. All that time burned on the mobile game was worth it.

  * Inspired by strangers on TikTok I tried making some Ramlets (Ramen Omelettes) and honestly they're really delicious. You cook instant ramen without the flavour sachet, mix the powder into some eggs, make an omelette but distribute the ramen before it cooks so it's kind of an eggy noodly slab. Then you fold it over filled with stuff like spring onions, fried bacon or spam, and sriracha. Gonna try a veggie version with kimchi :eyes:

  * On Sunday we met up with Luke and went to see Come Dine With Me: The Musical. It was fun and silly.
