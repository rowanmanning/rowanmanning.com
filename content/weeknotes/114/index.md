  * We had our first zero-plans day and it was lovely, I enjoyed Christmas but I needed a proper rest.

  * The rest was short-lived though; on the 30th we went to Remi's for their birthday drinks and on the 31st we went to a party down the road. Fun but exhausting.

  * We played "Roll for Cocktail" on NYE. I love a bit of organised fun! Nothing too horrible was generated, except the Apple Sourz, Baileys, and Lemonade which tasted alright but looked and felt like a sponge.

  * Today we went on a walk from Ockley to Leith Hill, it was beautiful and I'm full of endorphins from being out in the country.

  * Back to the grindstone this week. I'm set on buying the maximum extra holiday this year, 50 days sounds delightful.
