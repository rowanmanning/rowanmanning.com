  * This week included Christmas Party #2. Drinks were free all night and there were no queues for them â€“ just pre-made cocktails ready on the bar. Perfect :+1: I'm told that some people were kicked out but I witnessed no real drama, unfortunately. Charlotte and I made a plan to leave as soon as the party was over to get [Wings of East](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Mf5Q1D7vNEnyKWoU7), it was a success, we avoided a second location and a hangover :clap:

  * Wednesday was in-person boardgames which was great fun. We had a fun team-based game of [Star Realms](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/147020/star-realms), I lost spectacularly at [Long Shot](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/295374/long-shot-dice-game), we all really sucked at [The Mind](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244992/mind) (the only co-op game we brought), and finished with [Skull](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/92415/skull).

  * Thursday was my favourite festive tradition: watching Die Hard in the office. We made lots of the same jokes, a few new ones, and had a very festive time.

  * Oh weird. The last time I mentioned Die Hard in a weeknote I also mentioned Wings of East. [Patterns are emerging](/weeknotes/60/).

  * On Saturday we finally visited [Parrillan](https://www.parrillan.co.uk/), we were given a voucher last Christmas and it was close to running out. Lots of the tapas was excellent, but the stew was a bit meh and overpriced.

  * On Sunday we popped over to see Jenn & Chris, drank some wine and cocktails, and had a nice catch-up; this is why my weeknote is late. Worth it.

  * Since giving up on Advent of Code I've been working on a little side project. I'm rebuilding all the tooling for my various open source projects, massively over-engineering it and taking inspiration from some of the tools we have at work. [It's been fun](https://github.com/rowanmanning/toolchain#readme)!

    It'll probably look vaguely familiar to FT people. Why can't I use something that exists already? Sounds dull and a lot less work.
