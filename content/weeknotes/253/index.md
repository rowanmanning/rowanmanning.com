  * A lazy lazy week of lounging around and doing not much. Obviously I progressed a lot with Crusader Kings â€“ one game where I nearly united India under the Sri Lankan banner, and another where I kept Cornwall independent for a good 500 years (mostly by destabilising England every time they got vaguely powerful).

  * Over the weekend we stayed down in Faversham for Hop Festival and hung out with all of Charlotte's old friends. It was a lovely time, I drank a lot and we avoided most of the big crowds.

  * We're off up north for a couple of weeks, working part time and staying near the peaks so we can go for lots of nice walks in the countryside. We're taking the lads with us so their travel crate is out. They _love_ it until we force them into it.
