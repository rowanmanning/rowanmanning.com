  * [Ark Nova](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/342942/ark-nova) is a really great board game. I can see why people compare it to Terraforming Mars - good level of complexity and a lot of cards + replayability. I enjoyed it!

  * Charlotte and I played [It's a Wonderful World](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/271324/its-a-wonderful-world) a couple of times to test the waters with the cats. I expected them to be very interested / chaotic but they were well behaved! Great that we can play at home :+1:

  * I had a three day work week that felt like two weeks :joy: but now I'm off for a week. We're visiting various grandparents and chilling at home. Maybe a bit of painting.

  * Over the weekend we visted Sherborne with some friends. It's a cute town, I ate a _lot_ of baked goods. We were staying in a beautiful house with no central heating, there's something quite nice about hot waterbottles and huddling round electric heaters though.

  * Charlotte's mum stayed with the lads and they had a great time :heart:
