  * [Blue Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Prince) is _so good_, it's very rewarding finding lots of little secrets and solving puzzles that span multiple rooms across the house. We're playing a little bit most nights and we quickly realised we'd need a physical notebook to write down all the clues and information. It's too early to say but this could easily jump to the very top of my list of puzzle games.

  * On Friday we headed to Richmond to see [Misdomer Murders on Stage](https://midsomeronstage.com/) and it was _great_. Daniel Casey did a good job of stepping into John Nettles' shoes :thumbs_up: the staging was excellent, and they replicated flashbacks and memory sequences in a way that was so true to the TV series.

  * On Saturday, Charlotte and I went to Blackheath fireworks via a curry. Despite it being _ridiculously_ crowded the show was actually amazing, not complaining but when did we start doing fireworks along to music? I just don't remember it from childhood. We made ourselves feel very ill on a spinny ride, never again.

  * I'm feeling more invigorated about the union again now that we've got a new officer and we're able to focus more on growing membership instead of casework. It's why I joined and it's more suited to my skills. Our last newsletter was full of information and we're ready to start increasing numbers again.

  * I'm a bit obsessed with a new lunch at home, it sparks a lot of joy, Charlotte thinks it's disgusting. It's a tin of mackerel fillets in tomato sauce on toast, and it's wonderful. I'm craving fish and I wonder if I'm deficient in something.

  * After a couple of weeks of treating it with suspicion, the lads (well, Tom Barnaby) have finally accepted their new radiator bed. It's cute.
