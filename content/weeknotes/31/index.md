  * I had my first jab, I'm part-vaccinated! As a kid, I was super scared of needles, which I told the person injecting me, but it was fine :tada: The St Thomas' vaccination centre was so efficient â€“ I'm pretty impressed. It's also nice being able to pop across the road for it. My arm aches but no other side effects.

  * I feel like I've been near-useless at work this week. I just can't get motivated, then I guilt spiral because I feel like I'm letting down my colleagues by getting very little finished. So that's fun. I think part of the issue is too much context-switching, and I need to cancel a few meetings and get better at carving out time to get focused work done.

  * Charlotte was busy every evening this week so I played a lot of Minecraft. I set up a server with the [Create mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create), [Luke](https://twitter.com/lucas42) and I have been building some big contraptions to automate producing resources. I love how much the automation in this mod feels in keeping with vanilla Minecraft.

  * I'm gonna go into the office again next week because [Lee](https://leemoody.co.uk/) is coming down from Sheffield and I haven't seen him in 18 months. I'm genuinely excited for some more small talk with whoever else is in.

  * Charlotte discovered an AMAZING thing we can do with the blender via the internet. You chop up and freeze a couple of bananas, then blend them with a little bit of milk until they're completely smooth and slightly frothy. The texture is _exactly_ like ice cream and it's delicious.

  * The weather on Friday and Saturday has made me a lot happier, and next week at work feels more achievable already. Maybe I just needed a bit of sun in my life? I'm gonna go and have a few drinks outside.
