  * I had a lovely time in Edinburgh, it was cold but festive.

  * We stayed in an Airbnb that had no central heating but a small electric heater and an abundance of blankets. It was cheaper than the _very_ expensive hotels at this time of year. There was a power cut on the last night which was fun :+1:

  * We did a bunch of Christmas shopping, occasionally stopping for a drink to reward ourselves for going in shops.

  * On Wednesday we went for a very belated meal for Charlotte's birthday. We got the tasting menu at [Purslane](https://www.purslanerestaurant.co.uk/) and it was incredible – easily one of the best we've done, everything was delicious.

    On Thursday we went on the most polished whisky tour I've ever been on, it was expensive but fun, and it was interesting to see the 3,384 bottle collection.

  * On Friday we [walked along the Water of Leith](https://www.waterofleith.org.uk/walkway/), 13 miles of pretty countryside and interesting bits of the city. After that we decided that we deserved a munchy box. I've had Sunshine on Leith in my head since the walk.

  * On Saturday we got a train down to Huddersfield to attend L&A's Christmas party. Karaoke started _very_ early, it was a fun night! I ended with a pretty great (I'm told) rendition of Candy Man by Aqua, which is probably _not_ one that I'll pull out at our work Christmas party this week.

  * It's good to be home. The lads have learned how to break into their food drawer to chew on pouches, I'm proud of their ingenuity but annoyed.
