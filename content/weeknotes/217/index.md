  * My ankle is finally on the mend and I'm getting around without a crutch, albeit slowly. I managed to get some Christmas shopping done and it's been great to be in less pain.

    The 19th was Tom Barnaby and Douglas Fir's first birthday! We celebrated with a few drinks and made them cat-friendly tuna pizzas. They're spoiled lads. They're technically adults now!

    They've also been enjoying terrorizing our baubles.

  * Tom Barnaby spent Sunday being sick. A lot! It was quite worrying and we ended up forking out for an emergency vet. He was given some anti-sickness meds and has been improving since but it was a worry for a while.

  * Just continuous drains on our festivity eh?

  * I'm at 250 hours of Factorio since Space Age released in August :sweat_smile: at least half of that has been December but hey it's Christmas, and I've been a bit house-bound.
