  * We've had a rotating cast of cleaners since Vanessa, our regular, moved back to Italy. There have been ups and downs, I'm probably always gonna feel slightly awkward about _having_ a cleaner and so I'm quite bad at explaining what I want and providing feedback.

    A particularly notable clean involved towel animals, furniture moved into jaunty angles, and every loose item in the house being placed indiscriminately into the nearest drawer.

  * On Wednesday we had a goodbye dinner for Gallal on Brick Lane. The Pride of Spitalfields is a nice little pub and I ate an unreasonable amount of food.

    This weekend we went back to Butlins in Skegness for another  [2000s Weekender](https://www.bigweekends.com/weekends/back-to-the-2000s). Once again, it was really fun. The lineup wasn't _quite_ as good as [last time](/weeknotes/125/) but we did get to see Gareth Gates again. He's refined his set list to be all covers except Spirit in the Sky, not sure how I feel about that. Tinchy Stryder was pretty good.

    No hangovers :+1: partly because we played it a little safer than usual but mostly (pretty sure science would agree) because our final drink of each night was a Berocca.
