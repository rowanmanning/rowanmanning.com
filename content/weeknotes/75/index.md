    title: "A small pile of 8 tooth-related medals"

  * I'm finally feeling more normal, far less snotty and my cough's pretty much gone :tada:

  * I did a lot of spending on myself this week. I bought a new suit (we have three weddings this year and I want to look nice) and some new clothes because my wardrobe has really stagnated over two years of rarely going out. I look great in a suit, I'll provide evidence when I pick it up next week.

  * I think I've done enough treating myself with bonus money and should probably pay off some more of my mortgage or something sensible :thinking:

    Oh, ages ago we got new toothbrushes with an app. I think [I'm very susceptible to a bit of gamification](https://crossword.rowanmanning.com/), and I'm consistently getting 100% scores (complete coverage and the correct pressure for >2 minutes). Why am I like this? Look at my medals though.

  * We went to a practice bottomless brunch with [Jenn](https://twitter.com/teachlearncode) & [Chris](https://twitter.com/mowjj) which was delightful. It was a practice for when we go and do another bottomless brunch another time. I was very happy and fun to be around if I say so myself, but then later on I sent some embarrassing text messages and fell asleep in the corner of the bar. The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.

  * Guess what, friends, I found myself getting legitimately excited during my team's Q2 OKR session. What a dweeb. I've not done loads of [{{< abbr "Site Reliability Engineering" >}}SRE{{< /abbr >}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_reliability_engineering)-type work throughout my career so far and I'm not sure why, it's rewarding.

  * I'm not 100% sure about the new season of Killing Eve. Does it feel like it's squeezing too much in maybe?

  * I'm 100% sure that the slight tweaks to the Masterchef format this year are great. Another few baby steps towards being as good as Masterchef Australia :eyes:
