  * Charlotte's not drinking in October so we went to an ideally-timed alcohol free drinks tasting. Some of the alternatives are pretty impressive nowadays; some of the wine _didn't_ just taste like juice and there was an 0% whisky that kinda astounded me. We followed it up with delicious pho in [Viet Garden](https://www.vietgarden.co.uk/).

  * On Friday my evening plans were cancelled due to COVID (not mine) but I was quite glad to have a restful evening because&hellip;

  * I bought myself a new laptop! I spent Friday evening setting it up, realising my dotfiles no longer work on a fresh machine. It's an M4 Pro with a 14-core CPU and it's _just so fast_. My old Intel machine lasted me a good 6 years but was really starting to show its age. I continue the trend of having a better home Mac than work will give me the next time I get an upgrade.

  * On Saturday we popped to Waterloo to hang out with Scott, Lowry, and their baby who we had yet to meet. Very chill baby, my favourite kind. Little bit of shopping on the way home and then an early night :relaxed:

  * Sunday was a LOT of fun, we were part of a very extravagant engagement of 40 people (it was a yes) and now _hopefully_ we'll get to go to a three part wedding in the UK, Nigeria, and Jamaica. It was a fun day!

  * You can tell it's getting a little wintery because the lads are being extra cuddly. Tom Barnaby has re-remembered how nice it is to be under a duvet :heart:
