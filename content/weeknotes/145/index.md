  * We caved and started watching The Bear because people kept talking about it. We're 1½ series down and I understand the hype now, it's beautiful. Season 2 episodes 6 & 7 ("Fishes" and "Forks") are some of the best TV episodes I've seen in a long time.

  * We made lots of progress at work this week, I'm super excited about our current project because we can already see how much it's going to help improve our tech estate. Like, almost every day another thing cropped up which led us all to ask "Why has nobody built this yet?".

    At the FT we have quite a lot of different (and disparate) systems that we use to monitor our services. We're pulling all these different data sources into a single suite of dashboards. It's gonna help us to manage incidents and monitor our systems, and it's also gonna help us work out the parts of our estate that could use some attention.

  * On Thursday it was Mo's leaving drinks, there was a nice turnout and I had a great time. [Arjun](https://www.thegadhian.com/) and I decided not to use it as our monthly Jägerbomb day, very sensible, and I had some nice chats with people.

  * Shout out to the person who said that reading all my colleagues' blog posts was a waste of time. The hardest of disagrees, buddy.

    We've made a bunch of house progress, the office shelves aren't quite up yet but the area's prepped and I'm feeling motivated to do it. What I _did_ do was finally cut mattes to size for some of our artwork and mount it in the second-hand frames I bought ages ago.

    I don't think I've done any proper framing since art college. It was as painful as I remember but I felt really great about it afterwards, my poor cutting board has been a mouse mat for a very long time.
    
    Shout out to the [Fiskars Fingertip Detail Knife](https://www.fiskars.com/en-us/crafting-and-sewing/products/craft-knives-and-blades/fingertip-detail-knife-loop-design-163050-1001), still perfect, I'll never look back.
