  * I don't think I could have hoped for a better result RE the council elections. What a thorough trouncing for the Tories eh? I don't know if I've felt so positive about UK politics since Jeremy Corbyn was around. Fingers crossed my optimism isn't rewarded in the same way eh?

  * On Friday we finally finished all the required work on our flat. The electrician replaced our _very_ outdated consumer unit and installed our new induction hob and now everything in the flat works again! What a joy. We managed to use the hob once before we went away; friends, I've missed eating pasta so very much. I made a very delicious Cacio e Pepe with some fried lardons and vegetables. I had three hobs on the go just because I could.

  * On Saturday we flew out to Malm√∂ via Copenhagen ahead of Eurovision. We have tickets to some of the semifinal dress rehearsals and I'm excited :tada:

  * Malm√∂ seems like a lovely city, we're staying just outside the center in an Airbnb; one of the ones that is _actually_ someone's home and it's really cute. The suburbs around here are super pretty with lots of flowers and blossom-covered trees and it feels super springy. Everyone's very friendly.

  * Great to see lots of Palestinian flags around the place, I don't think Eurovision's "apolitical" stance is gonna fly here and there are a couple of protests against Israel's participation.

  * The food here has been excellent so far. I can't get enough meatballs.

  * Ahead of J&C arriving, we went on a day trip to Copenhagen and visited Tivoli, the world's second-oldest amusement park. It's like stepping back in time :heart: It's extremely well maintained and looked after.

  * It's weird to leave the lads for the first time, I miss them quite a lot ü•π we hired a cat sitter because we need someone to be there most of the time and it felt a bit restrictive to ask one of our friends to do it. She seems nice and the boys are warming to her based on the pictures she's been sending.

  * Right, I have to go, gotta try on some sequined clothing ready for the show this eve :sparkles: have a nice week.
