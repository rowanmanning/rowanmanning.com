  * [Reintroductions](/weeknotes/271/) have been coming thick and fast. I can have eggs now, to no ill effect. Bread and potatoes make me _very_ mucus-heavy for a little while, which is interesting and probably something new and exciting. I looked into the symptoms a little and Candida Overgrowth can cause gut issues (✅), skin issues (✅), fatigue (✅), and excess mucus production (✅) especially when eating starchy or sugary foods. I'm speaking to a medical professional tomorrow about the possibility, I know you're excited to hear more.

  * Introducing beer as my _fourth_ item is certainly a look. I'm going to Germany next week and I fully intend on drinking and I'd rather learn now, in the comfort of my own home, if it makes me nearly shit myself.

    With the addition of bread I decided it was time to eat one of the fancy tinned mackerels that Charlotte got me for my birthday. Mackerel on toast is infinitely better than mackerel on rice cakes, it made me very happy.

  * It was a busy week, on Wednesday I popped along to board games in the office after work. It was fun! There were six of us so I bowed out of the second game and carried on writing tests, very lame but I'm really enjoying migrating Jest stuff to Node.js test runner at the mo.

  * On Thursday I went to [Arcadia](https://www.arcadiagames.co.uk/) with Luke and played D&D! As a player! I got into the swing of it pretty quickly, everyone I met was really nice and the little adventure we went on was fun. I'm playing a Tortle Monk named Pimlos.

  * I'm DMing again this coming week, the session's gonna start with the party fighting an Owlbear and it should be fun! I've had a bit more time to plan out the next two sessions and I'm excited for the players to continue exploring 😊

  * On Saturday we went to see The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Live, an immersive theatre show. It was pretty good, I'm not _100%_ sure immersive theatre is for me – the chance that someone nearby might just break into song makes me feel a little on edge.
