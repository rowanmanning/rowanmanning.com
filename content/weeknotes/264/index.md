  * I had a lovely time on Tuesday meeting up with Andrew, Ed, and Dan. Just a casual catch up, a few pints of Jubel and then home for dinner. Woke up bright and early on Wednesday, I'm so sensible nowadays!

  * I had a lovely time on Thursday for [Alice's leaving drinks](https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/weaknotes-376) (:cry:). Just a casual leaving drinks, a few pints of Jubel, then a few more pints of Jubel, then a few wines, then a Jägerbomb or two, and then home. Had to drag myself out of bed on Friday, why am I like this?

  * On Friday, after aformentioned dragging, Charlotte and I met Luke in St Pancras and we got the train up to Matlock for a second [viewing](/weeknotes/260/) of a very lovely house :eyes: the train is really easy, I think people would happily come visit! It pissed it down with rain the whole day, we sampled some tea rooms and pubs and it feels nice there.

  * On Saturday, Charlotte and I got to Room 46 in [Blue Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Prince) after a real blend of skill and luck. It took us 21 in-game days to get there after solving many funa dn rewarding puzzles. Love this game, now for some other challenges.

  * On Sunday we drove down to Canterbury to visit Charlotte's grandparents. We took a veggie lasagna which was delicious and spent a wholesome few hours chatting.

  * I'm planning a couple of {{< abbr "Dungeons & Dragons" >}}D&amp;D{{< /abbr >}} sessions at the moment and I'm having such a lovely time with it. Hoping to run a two-parter with some of my old group with the potential for it to evolve into a full campaign. Getting back into world-building feels like coming home.

  * Oh my sweet Shrimp Jesus I nearly forgot: in Matlock we went into a tat shop and found a display of AI-generated posters which is _wild_. I keep wondering how many actual humans were involved in the process to get these things designed, produced, purchased, and then displayed _IN A SHOP_. And nobody questioned them!? We are truly living in the future.
