  * On Tuesday we had some leaving drinks at work for a couple of tech directors who are leaving. It kicked off a quite boozy week and I had some regrests on Wednesday. Christmas time!

  * Still ready for a break. After this week I only have two days left before I'm off for Christmas :relaxed:

  * On Friday, Luke came round and we watched Hot Frosty, the new Netflix Christmas film. Gotta say I _loved_ it. The premise is basically: snowman comes alive, is ripped. It's all there in the name.

  * On Saturday we went to an escape room with a few friends then to Christmas Pizza which is a yearly tradition now. It was a fun time until...

  * I stepped off a curb because I was texting and not looking where I was going. Friends, my ankle is pretty fucked (luckily not broken) and I'm gonna be on crutches for our work Christmas parties which is less than ideal. Just gotta hope it's better for our trip to Austria in a few weeks :sweat_smile:
