  * Happy New Year, friends!

  * This is going to be a short one because I'm tired and haven't been doing a lot.

  * A friend we hung out with on Boxing Day got COVID so we isolated and did a PCR. Apparently, we're fine :shrug: still mystified that we haven't got it yet tbh. I'm very tired which is a symptom, right?

  * I got a bit drunk for new year, on the Monster and White Wine. I spent the next day being more tired than usual.

  * I don't want to go back to work, possibly ever. I'm just too tired for all of that business.

  * I managed to fill some holes and prep the walls for painting between naps.

  * Have I mentioned that I'm tired?
