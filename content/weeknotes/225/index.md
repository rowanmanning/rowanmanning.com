    Heart-Shaped Food Day was this week. I didn't get stressed this time because I picked a bunch of elements I already know how to cook well. We had heart-shaped tostadas with refried beans, roasted sweet potato, guacamole, pico de gallo, and pickled red cabbage. Turns out that cutting tortillas with scissors is way easier than trying to chop heart-shaped veg with a knife.

  * I've been playing [Astro Bot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astro_Bot) for a couple of weeks and it's really picked up since I completed Factorio. It's one of the most adorable games I've played and it's so joyous, I really love it. Obviously I'm gonna have to 100% this one. Thanks to all the people who recommended it!

  * My PS5 controllers have been really showing their age, with batteries barely lasting an hour. I decided to have a go at replacing them and it was susprisingly easy. It cost me £30 and half an hour of my time to have two good-as-new controllers, which is a lot better than £120. Obviously, [YouTube provided the instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoEuHuAT5tU).

  * I paid for a Now TV subscription so I can watch The White Lotus season 3 (very excited). Unfortunately there's really not a lot else on there I want to watch, any recommendations? We started Veep and enjoying it so far.

  * Veep though, it's definitely suffering in that it'd difficult to make political satire nowadays. I'm sat back thinking "hmm this version of the US government feels pretty kind, efficient, and not scary in the slightest". I think we might be cooked.

  * If you're doing a presentation on a potentially-divisive subject, should you include anonymous Q&A? Asking for a friend.
