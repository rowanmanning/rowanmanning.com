  * This week was very Union-heavy! On Monday we had a members meeting and discussed shared issues ahead of our company's feedback survey. On Tuesday the reps had a useful meeting with the FT's new CEO and then another chat with our HR rep, all pretty good things.

  * Because of various meetings and commitments I was in the office four days this week. _Exhausting_, I have no idea how I used to manage this.

  * On Wednesday, Lee, Sam, and I went to The Ned for a roundtable with one of our vendors. It's fancy, great buffet lunch and was good to talk to some other news organisations who share our pain when it comes to bot scraping.

    We moved our usual after-work drinks to Friday, I was being very sensible but I _did_ participate in shot roulette, which was horrible.

  * On Saturday we drove up to Daventry for Dan and Jen's wedding. It was a lovely day, didn't chat to the bride and groom much (standard) but I got to catch up with my old Brighton D&D group. Lots of reminiscing!

    I was extremely sensible (for me), I had two beers over the seven hours and drove us and a few new friends back to our hotel. Woke up feeling great, I'd like some applause please.

  * Blue Prince continues to be the best puzzle game I've ever played. Charlotte's fingers ache from all the note-taking, we're at a very healthy 16 pages of a moleskine to keep track of all the information and puzzles.

  * No spoilers but the Celebrity Traitors finale eh!? Great TV, I highly recommend it even if you didn't like the normy version.
