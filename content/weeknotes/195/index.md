  * I started the week dropping off a friend's artwork at a gallery where she's exhibiting. It was a long trek out to South Kensington but I rewarded myself with a Ben's Cookie.

  * Work was fun, we're finishing off a few tasks for our Insurance Policy, a tool to help us recover from large infrastructure outages and make sure we can still serve article content if there's a large outage outside of our control. It's exciting to get it ready for launch! The only shame is, fingers crossed, we'll never have to use it.

  * On Friday we took the lads to the park near our house and drank a few Pineapple Spritzes with Gallal. It was delightful. A Pineapple Spritz (the way we do it, please tell me if there's another name) is elderflower liqueur, pineapple syrup, prosecco, and a dash of soda water over a lot of ice. It's very refreshing.

  * On Saturday we went to a little party/BBQ at Remi's and had a nice time in the garden. We saw Charlotte's nephew again who's walking around now. The M&S Smoked Pineapple Daiquiri in a can is delicious.

    We walked from Charlton to North Greenwich via the gravel works, one of our favourite places. The O2 was kicking out so we took the cable car instead of trying to navigate the station. Fun!

  * I had to double-check that I hadn't yet named a weeknote "pineapple" before and it turns out I've never mentioned a pineapple on this website. Now I've said it 8 times. I wonder what other fruits have been getting a terrible deal? Anyway, pineapple is an excellent flavour even if you're mildly allergic. Now it's 9 times.

  * I finished [The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35066358-the-first-fifteen-lives-of-harry-august) and loved it all. Excellent read and I'll investigate more Claire North. This brings me to 24 books in 2024; double my original target but, now I think about it, a more fun goal to have had.

    I started [Base Notes by Lara Elena Donnelly](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58100591-base-notes) because it was cheap, turns out Charlotte has read it and loved it. I'm excited to see where it goes (gonna go out on a limb and predict that it's more sex and murder).
