  * It's week 100! I'm into triple figures. I should probably start working out if I'm gonna do anything special for week 137.

  * I'm sure you're bored of hearing it, but going back to work after a holiday is pretty easy when you enjoy your job :intolerably-smug-face:

  * I was reminded by [Emma's weeknotes](https://emma-lewis.com/weeknotes/week-7/) that I watched Everything Everywhere All at Once while away, I agree it was incredible, I enjoyed every moment of it. It's also nice learning which friends you can watch things with â€“ I'm a "silence while I'm watching a film" person and I think I've surrounded myself with like-minded people.

  * I got most of the way through reading [All That's Left in the World](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/58329296) which was recommended based on Heartstopper. It's been a pretty quick read so far and it's just quite sweet â€“ it's given me the feels a few times. I'm enjoying the switching perspectives between the two protagonists.

  * [Luke](https://twitter.com/lucas42) had some early birthday drinks which were fun. Charlotte isn't drinking for October and her sobriety seems to have rubbed off â€“ I felt like I hadn't really been drinking and had zero hangover :tada:

  * I spent Sunday playing Minecraft pretty much all day. We started with a fun game of bingo using [Bingosync](https://bingosync.com/), and then a few of us started a Skyblock server later in the day and spent many hours labouriously mining cobblestone. It was fun and relaxing.

  * I've also managed to really keep up staying on top of my open source projects recently. Since [pruning a few and tackling a mountain of Dependabot PRs](/weeknotes/70/), doing basic maintenance like this has just slotted nicely into my week. I think I can call it a success after 30 weeks right? I've merged or closed ~1,500 Dependabot PRs on my projects in that time ðŸ˜³

  * My team messed up slightly at work; we made a change which resulted in none of the FT.com teams being able to deploy for the best part of a day. It's important to normalise that this kind of thing happens and paint your fuck-ups as an opportunity to learn (especially when you're a team of pretty senior engineers). I very quickly wrote a post which explained what we did and our thought process, it was fun! I need to blog at work more.

  * I _finally_ got smart meters fitted in my flat. Boring subject, but it's been nearly a year of trying to make this happen. I can't believe I never have to go and top up a pre-pay meter in a shop again, luxury.
