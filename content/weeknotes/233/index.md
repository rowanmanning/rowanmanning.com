  * We ~~have~~ **had** ants in the kitchen. Unpleasant and my first time having the honour in London. Back home we used to get ants and mice and stuff all the time because our house backed onto fields. Anyway for a while the lads enjoyed watching the small ant columns.

  * I bought [Ark Nova](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/342942/ark-nova) while it was on sale, having played it [a while ago](/weeknotes/212/). It's a really great board game and supports two players. I spent a satisfying 30 minutes popping carboard tokens from their sprues.

      On Saturday we attended a mural unveiling around the corner and it was so lovely. There was a big party held in some nearby gardens, lots of music and food and chatting to strangers. It felt more like a community than I've ever experienced in London. The guest of honour was Ian McKellen and he stood very close to give a speech.

  * We had a little party at Alison's afterwards. I had a few Jägerbombs and fell asleep on the kitchen floor. This meant I missed a trip to St Christophers and I'm pretty glad because I felt OK on Sunday.

  * Gallal cooked us a hangover gratin which was very good, and we admired his recent flat decoration.
