  * Alex has been off this week and Ahmed left which means we've been an extra small team. That hasn't stopped us getting a lot done, we're very close to having a complete migration path ready for some of our apps and I'm excited about it.

  * Charlotte's been out a bit this week and I used the opportunity to complete [Factorio: Space Age](https://www.factorio.com/space-age/content) finally. Honestly one of the best games I've ever played, I spent an embarassing 434 hours optimising my factory, the equivalent of _62 full work days_. I could have completed it in half that time or less but didn't want to :grin: anyway [here's my Galaxy of Fame entry](https://factorio.com/galaxy/Calcite%20III:%20Eta3-6.C7T6), I'm particularly proud of the city blocks on Nauvis.

  * On Thursday we had what I'm counting as a first "proper" after work pub. Proper in that I got merry and bought a kebab on the way home. It was a fun time. Managed to dodge a real hangover.

  * On Saturday Charlotte and I had a wholesome day. We went to watch [Following Faraday's hint: The search for quantum gravity](https://www.rigb.org/whats-on/following-faradays-hint-search-quantum-gravity) at the Royal Institution. It was super interesting, Jim gates is very engaging. We went for Korean food nearby afterwards and had an earlyish night.

  * On Sunday we popped for a roast with Alison and not much else. We've been watching Grantchester which is a little bit cozy and silly.
