  * It was Charlotte's birthday this week, we're normally away for it so this was a rare at-home one. I decided to bake because [Charlotte always puts a lot of effort into my cakes](/tags/birthday/). I made peanut butter and salted caramel cupcakes (because I realised too late we don't have a pair of cake tins). They were pretty good, especially considering that I can't remember the last time I baked anything. In the evening we went out for dinner.

  * On Wednesday I popped around to Ed's for a few drinks, I'm glad to be seeing him and Andrew a bit more lately, I've missed them :heart:

  * On Thursday it was [Anna](https://www.annashipman.co.uk/)'s leaving drinks. She's the tech director for the part of the FT I work in and she was my line manager for a couple of years when I was a Principal engineer, I'm gonna miss her. Her leaving drinks were predictably well-attended by both current and past colleagues and it was a late one!

    I had a great chat with our new {{< abbr "Chief Technology Officer" >}}CTO{{< /abbr >}}. We've had quite a few CTOs over the past few years but this feels different â€“ she has opinions, she's keen on _action_, and she's been both visible and approachable. All great things, I'm both nervous and excited about how technology at the FT might change.

    On Saturday it was Charlotte's main birthday event, we went on a Corner Shop Crawl around Whitechapel to drink slushies (very high slushy density out east), eat a lot of snacks, and stop off in various parks to drink. It was a lot of fun! We had laminated maps, stars, and Sharpies so that we could rank the shops. Everyone got a reusable slushy straw as a party favour.

    We finished in a Simmons on Brick Lane and then stopped off at a pub near home before calling it a night. What a nice time :blush:
