  * Bad news, friends. I didn't win the EuroMillions.

  * On Friday I accidentally went to work despite having the day off. Alex asked half way through standup, "wait, why are you here, Rowan?". I don't remember why I booked it off so I played Factorio.

  * On Saturday we went for a long but quite flat/boring walk in Manningtree. The country air was nice, and we saw a couple of good weirs.

  * When we got home we started playing Cult of the Lamb. I didn't know anything about it but saw it was co-op, it's so much fun! Just slowly building our cute little cult and taking care of heretics.

  * On Sunday we went to Costco. What an exciting yet _exhausting_ place eh? I bought some shit I don't need, as is tradition.
