    Pitbull was one of the best gigs of my life - I've never been in a crowd that was _so hyped_ to be there. There were crowds of bald-capped fans all over the place near the O2 and on the tube there, many with speakers.

    What a great time, would recommend if he comes back to the UK.

  * We took Monday _and_ Tuesday off but I felt fine so I spent the whole day playing videogames. Baldurs Gate III is incredibly detailed and I'm playing a lot of it. I'm nearly done with Act II and I'm astounded at how well done it is.

  * Relatedly I bought all the 2024 Dungeons & Dragons core rule books because I'd like to get back into it, maybe running a one shot or a premade adventure with my old work group.

  * We've been enjoying the great weather, on Saturday we spent most of the day in London Fields eating and drinking and having naps in the sun. Perfect.
