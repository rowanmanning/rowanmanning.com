  * I can eat potatoes again! It's my birthday and I can't have cake so I'm eating my weight in chips. Chips for every meal: the dream. This isn't how I pictured turning 38 but here we are. I'll be sure to let you know if these potatoes make me shit myself or half my scalp falls off.

  * I ran the first D&D session of a three parter that will likely turn into a campaign. Oh my god it was exhausting but a lot of fun. We didn't quite make it to the first combat but all the players were really great at the role play bit and introducing their characters. I felt pretty wired afterwards and I've been making map/world tweaks to fit their ideas in.

    I found my first use of an LLM that I'm not immediately angry with, automated note-taking from Gemini was actually pretty good at putting together a session overview (obvs still with a few tweaks needed). The full transcript is absolute garbage but the bones was there, D&D session notes don't need to be accurate unlike many of the things people use this junk for.

  * We met a new cat sitter, the lads warmed to her very quickly so I feel fine going away to Germany in Feb :+1:

  * I have more D&D in the near future, session two of my own game and I'm going to a drop-in session (as a player) at [Arcadia Games](https://www.arcadiagames.co.uk/) with Luke this coming week. Fun! Some new dice arrived and I'm going to stop buying more now.

  * We're spinning the wheels in Blue Prince at the moment, lots of dud runs where we don't learn anything new. We've found 5 [redacted] but are strugging to work out what all the [redacted] are so we're trawling through notes and books from across the estate again.
