  * I'm finally gonna go see an allergy specialist. My psoriasis flare-ups are getting a bit more frequent and I have occasional breathing issues at night, and occasional bowel issues (overshare). Having exhausted other options it's time to see if I have any secret allergies or intolerances that are exacerbating things. 

  * Tom Barnaby got in a full on fight with the cat from [week 239](/weeknotes/239/), there was fur flying before he ran inside. He's fine, seems normal but less keen to go outside ðŸ¥º

  * Customer Products Day again on Wednesday meant seeing everyone in the office, drinks were fun and I was out far too late with Arjun, Glynn, and some of our new Sofia colleagues. Thursday was less fun but I lined up lots of boring repetitive work to tide me over.

  * [Lambeth Country Show](https://www.lambethcountryshow.co.uk/) was fun and really quite quiet due to the rain. We managed to get around and see everything except the vegetable sculptures. Some of the regular veg was beautiful but it's a shame not to see any giant specimens. We got rained on a lot but I ate a lot of great caribbean food.

  * I have Monday and Tuesday off for Pitbull (Mr. Worldwide himself). We're going full dress-up, you'll get to see me in a bald cap next week. I'm _very_ excited.
