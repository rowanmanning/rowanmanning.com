    We _finally_ got rid of the large corner sofa which was dominating the living room of our flat. We never used it and it wasn't comfortable. We've replaced it with a lovely table and chairs so that we don't have to eat off of our laps. I love it.

    I drove a van for the first time to go and pick it up. It went well but highlighted how much I rely on my rear-view mirror when driving, feels very unnatural not to be able to stare into the eyes of the person driving behind you.

    My [Shelly](https://www.shelly.com/) flood sensor arrived and I got it set up in Home Assistant. Now I'll get alerted if there's [dampness in the under-sink cupboard in the kitchen](/weeknotes/148/), so I can stop checking it compulsively every time I go in there :tada:

    As always, I love working in [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), it's such a brilliant system. I decided to buy a Zigbee radio for the Raspberry Pi that it runs on so that I can reduce WiFi network load and remove some of our reliance on the Internet being available. I also found that it's possible to get UK smart meter data piped in so I can use Grafana to chart our energy usage over time. [This guide was useful](https://www.homeassistantcoach.com/how-to/smart-home-integrations/how-to-setup-a-smart-meter-smets-in-home-assistant/).

  * Thursday pub was delightful, glad I put sunscreen on.

  * On Friday we went to our only wedding of the year, Lou & Char got married down in Kent, on the grounds of a country house which was lovely. The ceremony was really sweet despite us baking in the sun, the brides seemed to have the best time.

    Despite not knowing a lot of people outside of Charlotte's family (Lou is her cousin), it was a lot of fun. Various other family members are also considering moving to Brighton; the list of people to visit when we go down just keeps growing :heart:

    A weird small-world moment was meeting someone and discovering they're the brother of one of my colleagues. I love it when things like this happen.
