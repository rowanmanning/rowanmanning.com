  * Still no [yearnote](/tags/yearnote/) for my fourth year of weeknotes. The year happened, I'm sure I'll get around to it.

  * I think the January blues are over now. I'm feeling a lot more like myself, I'd dare to say I've been _chirpy_ this week. My guess is that it's a combination of not being sick and not being sleep-deprived.

  * I've been doing some interesting stuff at work around tooling for a large migration. It frequently moves at a snail's pace but it's worth it for the occasional little flurries of activity which leaves my team feeling super productive. Something I enjoy immensely about my team is that, when the main thing is quiet, there's a near-infinite pool of interesting side work to pick up.

  * On Thursday, Charlotte and I went to a light up thing in Shoreditch and spoke to some strangers very successfully. The lights themselves were a bit naff but we had food and some cocktails afterwards.

  * Saturday was nice, we went for a walk with the Whitechapel crew (plus Luke) out in Abbey Wood. Then we came back towards home and tried out a few new local pubs. We ended in the Hospital Tavern drinking Long Island Iced Teas then crashed Harry Styles' Birthday Party (karaoke) upstairs.

  * Just obsessed with these perfect angry lads.

    They've grown a lot in ~10 months.
