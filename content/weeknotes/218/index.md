  * It was another Christmas in Hull. Driving was fine on my ankle and we had a nice time. Nothing was very relaxing though - Charlotte and I made the dinner and we were keeping an eye on the cats a lot.

  * Tom Barnaby is an idiot and he's obsessed with tinsel. This would be fine if he didn't keep trying to eat it (very bad). Our house is now a tinsel free zone but the Airbnb had plenty, it was stressful tbh.

  * The lads did love the stairs. They kept racing up and down them and walking along the top of the bannister.

  * We drove back to London on Boxing day then up to my family on the 27th. No time for rest!

  * The 28th was supposed to be a chilled day but we ended up having to do a lot of prep for the second Christmas dinner on 29th.

  * I'm very tired heading into new year. We'll be spending it down in Brighton with a few friends :slight_smile:
