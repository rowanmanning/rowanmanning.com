    title: "One of Whitechapel's belligerent squirrels squaring up to me"

  * I've been reminded this week how quickly time passes when you're playing Factorio. Space Age is amazing, I love it. I love it enough to have spent 55 hours on it over the course of my week off :sweat_smile:

    I made it to Vulcanus, I'm astounded at how much bigger this game is now. I probably need to cool off a bit before I burn out.

  * Alison has moved nearby (like literally a minute's walk away)! It's been great having a new neighbour and we helped her put together furniture and clean the place a little. _Maybe_ we don't need to buy a car after all â€“ Alison has offered to insure me on hers which will save a lot of car hire money.

  * On Friday we went to see some comedy with Alex and Christina which was a lot of fun. Union Chapel is amazing and I'm annoyed with myself that I never visited when I lived right around the corner.

  * The squirrels around here are quite belligerent. There's one in the trees near our flat that frequently YELLS at me and the cats if we're in the car park. When walking past the park this week another one followed me down the road.
