  * Still a bit under the weather, still tired all the time, January eh? I had a pretty quiet week.

  * On Friday, Charlotte and I went to Rogues in Bethnal Green. The food was excellent and it was pretty reasonable. Their menu changes daily depending on what's available at markets nearby, ours was quite bovril and kohlrabi heavy so I guess bovril was on offer.

  * On Saturday I went for a few birthday drinks with some friends, we spent most of the evening in The Hungerford Arms which is my new favourite pub. Less than Â£5 for most pints, it's a bit of an old man pub which suits me. Then we went for some food at Needoo.

  * On Sunday I turned 37, it was quite a relaxed day, I intentially did nothing. As is tradition, Charlotte made me lemon-based birthday treats; every year is better than the last! I'm obsessed with cinammon buns at the moment so she made me Lemon and Cardamom buns, they're incredible.
