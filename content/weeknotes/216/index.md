    title: "A slightly naff Christmas decoration I made by cutting out snowflakes from coloured paper"
---

  * Hello. We're not in Austria, as planned. Charlotte still had COVID at the time we were supposed to fly and I can't walk very far so staying up a mountain probs wasn't the best idea. Currently discovering that claiming through travel insurance is considerably harder than purchasing travel insurance :thumbs_up:

  * Life goes on. It'd be nice if we were feeling more festive but we're not. At least I'm off work for the rest of the year and we're managing occasional Christmas films and Whisky Macs.

    Work Christmas Party #1 (the whole company) was alright, I managed it on a crutch and discovered that _everyone_ wants to know what you did. I'm going to assume at least some of the enquiries were out of care and not schadenfreude.

    What was excellent is that I didn't have to queue at the bar once. Thanks, friends, for looking after me ðŸ˜„

    I sat down and made a slightly naff Christmas decoration in the quiet/craft room to give my ankle a rest.

  * Christmas Party #2 (my department) was great! It was at Rio Cinema which was easy for me to get to and it started with a showing of The Muppet Christmas Carol - one of my all time favourites. This got me feeling festive: I had a lot of nice chats, an attempt at dancing on my crutch, had a few JÃ¤gerbombs, and told plenty of my friends/colleagues that I love them.
