  * This week was the first FT Boardroom (boardgame night) in a few years, it was so much fun. We mostly played large party games but that was what we were all in the mood for. Several rounds of very competitive [Codenames](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames) were my highlight.

    On Wednesday a visitor came to stay for a week, Rocky was very nervous at first but I think he's warmed to us and he's quite sweet and cuddly. It's nice having a cat around again and he's very easy.

    In two weeks we'll have two kittens and then all you'll hear about for months is them.

  * On Friday it was Rhys' leaving drinks. I thought I was being very smart sticking to shandy all night, except it turns out that every shandy has a half pint in it and those add up. I got quite drunk and then I stayed in bed for all of Saturday feeling like the room was spinning. I ranted about AI a lot and we made some friends on the bus home. Turns out The Sea Horse does Karaoke on a Friday night.

  * On Sunday we went for breakfast with Gallal and then a roast with Luke, both were delightful :heart: probs didn't need the bottle of Sauternes to finish but I do love a sweet wine.
