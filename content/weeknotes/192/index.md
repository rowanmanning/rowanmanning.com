  * Short weeknote, I cba to add a lot of detail because I'm trying to watch We Are Lady Parts at the same time.

    We went to Zoo Nights at London Zoo, it was a gift from Charlotte's mum and it was nice! It's a lot less busy and chilled. We saw lion cubs. We watched armadillos run after a keeper with a pot of crickets.

  * On Sunday we walked from Seaford to Eastbourne along the seven sisters. It was perfect weather. We had to take our shoes off to cross a river.

  * I finished [The Left Hand of Darkness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18423.The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness) and really loved it by the end. I struggled a little with the first half but binged the second half in no time at all. I picked up [Station 11 by Emily St. John Mandel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20170404-station-eleven) and it's a delight to be back in a nice comforting little dystopia.

  * I spent a bit of time (on personal projects and at work) migrating things to use TypeScript 5.5. It was boring. Migrating to [Node.js native test runner](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html) was less boring, getting rid of some dependencies.
