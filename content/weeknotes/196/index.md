  * It feels like I spent a bit too much of this week hungover. On Friday after morning standup I had to go back to bed - the first time in years I've been that bad on a work day :sweat_smile: I'll make up the time, mostly out of embarrassment.

  * It's now No Plans Week. It's a week where a few friends have agreed to have nothing booked into our calendars so that we can be spontaneous. This spontaneity is partly responsible for my hangovers. The rest I'm blaming on the several good friends who decided to have birthdays on the same days. Lovely times though.

  * I built [a new open source](https://github.com/rowanmanning/repo-tools/tree/main/packages/node-versions#readme) library that works out which Node.js versions a repo claims to support. I found that I've repeated this code in many different places both on personal projects and at work, makes sense to publish it.

  * I generally like work but I've been struggling _slightly_ in recent weeks with the pace of change â€“ tech improvements can feel glacial. Right now we're steering an oil tanker. I'm under no illusions that we'll ever be a speedboat but I think Thames Clipper is a reasonable stretch goal.

    I think a little part of it is convincing people to take technical risks and be OK switching something off even if "it might be useful if X". Once I've got past the moaning phase I'll try and do something more about it.
