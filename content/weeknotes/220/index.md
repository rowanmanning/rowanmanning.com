  * We've got some nice January sickness going on. Charlotte and I both spent most of the weekend sleeping and feeling awful, lots of cancelled plans. I blame the office - it's pretty much all we did this week and people love uncovered coughing there. COVID taught us nothing.

  * This is going to be a boring weeknote as a result tbh.

  * In Factorio news I've played 350 hours so far on this save and have finished a third rebuild of Nauvis into city blocks. Trains everywhere, it's glorious. At this point I'm fully capable of completing the game but I'm having too much fun still.

  * That's all I've got in me this morning I'm afraid. Back to bed.
