  * It's my 137th week, [which is special](https://www.thegadhian.com/posts/signs-you-have-started-a-cult/). _Way_ back in [Week 13.7](/weeknotes/13.7/) I thought to myself, "OK I have to make it to week 137 before I can reassess whether I enjoy writing weeknotes", and here we are. I hope that I don't lose motivation now that I've reached this goal.

  * OK. I just checked and week 1,370 will fall _on my birthday week_ in 2047 so I guess I have to keep going.

  * That's probably enough niche memes for this week.

  * I had a blood test on Monday, the first one I've had in my adult life. I thought I was all fine with needles now after the COVID vaccines but I nearly fainted so I guess not. Of course, all the NHS staff were wonderful.

  * On Tuesday I scraped some poo into a tube and dropped it off at the clinic as a thank-you gift.

  * I spent a lot of the week trying to debug why our Minecraft server is having network issues. It's been a little frustrating and still not fully sorted, but the silver lining is that I got to do some debugging with [Rowan](https://github.com/rowanbeentje). It was a joy. He's a lot more experienced with server admin-type stuff than I am and he's very patient, I feel like I learned a bunch.

  * We kicked off playing Minecraft v1.20 properly on Wednesday. At one point we had nine people online and we quickly turned the very plain spawn area into a disjointed home for us all. I forgot how lovely it is logging back into a server and seeing lots of stuff has changed. The server held up great, not a single lag spike.

  * I resolve to play at a more sustainable pace so I don't overdo it and burn myself out and/or get to late game super quickly.

  * I read this really interesting essay: [Modern software quality, or why I think using language models for programming is a bad idea](https://softwarecrisis.dev/letters/ai-and-software-quality/). I agree very much with the author's overall sentiment, that the fallout from people using "AI"-generated code (particularly for work) is going to be an absolute nightmare.

  * Over the weekend we went up to Leeds to see the city, see Scott (who moved up there in the pandemic), and go on a nice walk. Leeds is nice, though we didn't really get to see _loads_ of it. The walk was a slightly sweaty 14 miles but pleasant, and I got to eat cake at the end. We saw the Slabbering Baby along the route.
