  * We went to Wahaca with Leigh-Ann and Andy and met their baby, Arthur. He's very small and squished up and looks like an old man. The South Bank is _rammed_ nowadays and I'm kind of glad to be moving somewhere less touristy.

  * I'll hopefully have a little clarity on my flat purchase soon! It turns out that my mortgage broker works for the same large firm that manages the building I want to buy a flat in, which has shortened the chain of communication considerably. So I should have some more concrete dates on [cladding issues](/weeknotes/21/) being fixed as we now have a direct Building Manager > Broker line rather than Building Manager > Current Owners > Estate Agent > Me > Broker.

  * I found out the painful way that I'm allergic to something in Apple AirPods Pro :grimacing: I had what I thought was an ear infection ages ago, stopped using headphones because they hurt to put in, and it eventually cleared itself up. I used them (with brand new tips) earlier this week and had an almost immediate reaction ([apparently so do a bunch of people](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250896003)). It's almost better now and I bought some non-silicone replacement tips which I'll try when I'm feeling brave. I also used it as an excuse to replace my very old wired over-ear headphones with [AKG N60NCs](https://www.whathifi.com/akg/n60nc-wireless/review) which so far are great â€“ the active noise cancelling pretty much blocks out all the train screeching from Waterloo. Work is a lot more peaceful and I'm finding it easier to focus.

  * I tested myself (negative again) and went to visit my grandma and mum. It was so lovely to see them, but there's a constant stressor while I'm there because my family are basically ignoring every COVID rule there is. I guess it's a little different out of the city but I find myself biting my tongue a bit.

  * Are we all looking forward to ["friendly contact, intimate contact, between friends and family"](https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-boris-johnson-set-to-confirm-lockdown-rules-will-ease-from-17-may-as-government-in-delicate-talks-on-hosting-champions-league-final-12301434) being restored? :facepalm:
