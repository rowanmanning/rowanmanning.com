  * It's been a milestone week for the house, I spent most of the weekend Doing It Myself, putting up shelves and pictures.

    I'm super pleased that the shelves are mostly straight and seem secure. We bought a load of twin-slot shelving and we now have so much more storage in our office space. We might stain the wood later to be a bit darker, but tbh we probably won't notice it once they're full.

    * They allowed us to unpack the final two boxes, some books which have been sitting for nearly two years behind the door to this room.

    * The aim is to add a whole bunch of trailing plants, which I think will look lovely and soften the room a bit (please send recommendations for ones which don't need too much light). We can also both personalise the wall space around our desks more which will make it a nicer space to work in.

    I was also feeling motivated to finally put up the [now-framed](/weeknotes/145/) art that has been cluttering up our living room for an age. We've started a gallery wall behind our sofa and I love it. We've also started scattering other artwork around the rest of the house and it feels _so_ much more homey.

    Shout out to my A-Level sketchbook work on the far right :grin: it's done a lot of house moves with me and is still the only work I still like from back then.

  * At some point between putting up paintings and drilling holes in the walls, I met Glynn for a coffee nearby, what a nice weekend treat! He was taking his kid to Spitalfields city farm and I'm bummed I didn't have quite enough time to join them.

  * I'm a big fan of many of my colleagues, Thursday pub was particularly fun, Arjun and I had our monthly Jägerbombs and the world seemed very bright and exciting for the evening.

  * Every now and then I rediscover this _absolute banger_: [Rage Against the Machine vs Shaggy - Killing Mr. Boombastic In The Name Of Laba Laba](https://soundcloud.com/mixessss34/rage-against-the-machine-vs-shaggy-killing-mr-boombastic-in-the-name-of-laba-laba-dj-zebra). A gem of a mashup which is better than either original.

  * Gallo pinto, fried plantain, egg, and pico de gallo (mostly all present in a Costa Rican breakfast) was what I ate every day for two weeks while I was there. I think I've perfected my versions of each of these and it makes an amazing veggie dinner.

  * On Sunday night after all my hard work with the house, we went to see Barbie with Gallal. It was fun and silly and I enjoyed it.
