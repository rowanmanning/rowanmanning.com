  * Charlotte got back from her trip on Monday and we spent a couple of days together early in the week before she was off to visit her granny. It's nice to spend time apart but I'm being a little needy.

  * It's definitely shorts weather now. It's lovely, I feel so happy.
  
  * The sun normally really reduces my scalp psoriasis, but it's already been flaring so much less since [I started trialling a less stressful role at work](/weeknotes/63/).

  * I went into the office for part of Wednesday because [Jake](https://jakechampion.name/) is leaving the FT and was having some leaving drinks. I got a _little_ carried away, and I lost count of how many Jägerbomb [Arjun](https://www.thegadhian.com/) and I had at the bar.
  
    We got chatting to some lawyers who work nearby, I'm unsure what we spoke about but I found a business card in my pocket the next morning :shrug:

    Once the pub closed, [Chee and I](https://chee.party/2022/04/17/week-15-2022/) went for a nice sobering-up walk down to London Bridge and talked a lot, which was nice. We wandered around for a good couple of hours before I realised I should really go to bed and got a taxi home.

  * Thursday wasn't good but could have been _much_ worse. I made my 9:30 standup which is heroic even when I'm feeling 100% tbh.

  * It's [wild garlic](/weeknotes/23/) time again. I've eaten quite a lot, and picking up food that's just growing outside will never stop feeling wholesome.

  * We went away for the first half of the bank holiday weekend with a couple of friends and their dog. We stayed in a small cottage in the south downs and it was lovely to be out of the city for a while. The weather was beautiful, and Magnus is a very sweet boy.
