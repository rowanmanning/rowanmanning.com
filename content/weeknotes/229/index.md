  * Customer Products Day at work this week, it was really fun and in a completely different format. We had a day-long hack day and I had a great time working with some people who I wouldn't normally have chance to. I also got to write some PHP for the first time in _years_ and I'd forgotten less than I expected.

  * Charlotte's sick again with something that seems like flu or COVID, she can't catch a break this year! I've managed to avoid so far and have been forcing meds and vitamin C on her. It's been a lazy weekend as a result.

  * My grandma's in hospital which is worrying, but glad she's getting the care she needs. Hopefully nothing too serious but a bit of a struggle breathing and carpal tunnel mean she's not up to doing much by herself. Intending on visiting ASAP and trying not to stress about it.

  * With Charlotte sick we bought [Two Point Museum](https://www.twopointstudios.com/en/games/two-point-museum) which is really fun, a nice twist on a familiar format. We've been playing sporadically between naps.

  * The lads have been enjoying us both being here, we've invented a few new games (treat-based of course). One is putting treats under upturned plastic cups, they've _kind_ of worked out how to consistently tip them over and we may regret this. The other is easier - put treats in cereal boxes and watch them hurl themselves at the very narrow boxes to get in.
