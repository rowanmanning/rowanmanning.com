  * Hello April. Either I've managed to purge all the brands from my online life _or_ they're having too tough a time to bother with bad April Fools jokes. Either way's a win in my books.

  * Not much went on this week. I met a new catsitter for when we're away over easter. We have a good set of friends and family to ask but we don't want to take the piss, occasionally we suck up paying a stranger.

  * On Friday we had a fun neighbours evening, a few of us starting at Alison's to help finish her balcony decorations, then on to ours so Charlotte could bake a cake. We cooked together and spent no money (previously-bought house booze is free). It was lovely and exactly what I want from living so close to friends.

  * On Saturday we took the car down to Canterbury to visit Charlotte's grandparents. They're having a small struggle at the moment so we took a large shepherds pie and a cake so they have meals for a few days. They're looking after a pretty sweet and nervous dog named Biscuit who we took for a walk. Wholesome vibes all round, apart from the traffic through Blackwall Tunnel.

  * I'm still playing a lot of videogames, more consistently than I have in years; It's been nice. I'm playing my way through Red Dead Redemption II, I tried it _years_ ago but didn't have the patience so I restarted and it's a beautiful game. Like aside from all the murder I've been spending a ridiculous amount of time riding my horse, Jane McDonald, around the countryside, soaking in the vibrant world that Rockstar created. Very glad I picked it up again :+1:
