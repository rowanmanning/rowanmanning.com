  * Alison stayed over for a few days this week, was nice to see her. Excited for when she finishes buying her place round the corner. More people in Whitechapel :tada:

  * On Tuesday we went to a pub quiz at The Parakeet in Kentish Town. It was me, Charlotte, Tammy and Marcus and _we came first_! We won a Â£75 bar tab so now we have to go again at some point. I won us 5 bonus points by drawing the best parakeet doing balloons, proud moment.

  * Towards the end of the quiz Charlotte started feeling a little sick. Towards the end of Wednesday evening I started to feel it too. We've been mostly in bed since. I've mostly improved but Charlotte's still coughing a lot and feeling terrible.

  * We started watching Whitechapel because we wanted something easy and it's where we live. It includes _all_ my favourite things about modern Whitechapel: dark and smoggy alleyways, gangs, cockneys everywhere, people dressed like they could be in the 1800s, serial killers, various Southwark landmarks, and literally every single person being white. Feels like home, you know?
