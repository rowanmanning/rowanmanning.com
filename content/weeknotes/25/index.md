---

  * I got a haircut, got myself a negative COVID test result, and spent a bunch of time with friends. I really needed that.

  * I have a week off coming up and focus at work has been a struggle in the lead-up. We don't have any concrete plans for our time off but the weather is supposed to be nice so probably a lot of walking and sitting in parks.

  * I've been playing a lot of Assassin's Creed Valhalla, I've warmed to it now. I'm very rusty with gaming and my reactions aren't as good as they used to be. I've died an awful lot.

  * I drunkenly hugged a homeless man after a half-hour chat with him. I don't remember the conversation and hugging someone was a stupid thing to do â€“ I haven't hugged a friend or family member in over a year. Oops. Time to get re-tested I think :grimacing: at least I'm pretty certain _I_ didn't have coronavirus at the time

  * Charlotte and I have been doing crosswords a lot lately, I have a book of The Times crosswords from years ago and they're just about the right level of difficulty. The FT ones are too difficult. I'm also playing The New York Times mini crossword daily, and have a leaderboard with some friends.
