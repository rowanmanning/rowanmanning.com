			"html": "<p><img src=\"https://jamesg.blog/assets/james_hcard.jpeg\" alt=\"A piece of thermal printer with information about my website on it\" /></p>\n\n<p>When I started working on my thermal printer project, I decided that I would start following blogs on RSS again. I wanted to stay up to date with some bloggers whose work I enjoyed and RSS was the best way to do so.</p>\n\n<p>While I have followed people on RSS before and stopped because it was hard to keep up with my feed, the thermal printer introduced something new that has kept me on the RSS wagon: a physical feed that I will only see once per day. I can check on Feedly but I don‚Äôt really do that. I often forget to check on my RSS feed but my daily update, which prints the titles of posts that have been published in the last day, is printed every morning so I cannot miss new posts.</p>\n\n<p>This got me thinking about the idea of having a ‚Äúblogroll.‚Äù Blogrolls are pages where you list the blogs that you follow. I like this idea because it helps people discover other website owners. I have scrolled through a number of blogrolls in the past. Today I‚Äôm happy to announce my own blogroll that will reside in this post.</p>\n\n<p>This blogroll might never be updated again or I may keep it up to date. I‚Äôm not sure. For now, however, the list of links below are the blogs whose content I have appreciated in the past enough to include in my RSS feed. I get a print out of the titles of new posts from these creators each day. Some days there are very few posts, others I get close to five posts. I don‚Äôt always read the actual posts but I sometimes make a mental note to read one if a title sticks out.</p>\n\n<p>Without further ado, below is my blogroll. The first link is a link to the actual blog. The second link is a link to the RSS feed I subscribe to. You might want to subscribe to this feed if you use RSS.</p>\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"https://beesbuzz.biz/blog/\">busybee: fluffy rambles</a> (<a href=\"https://beesbuzz.biz/blog/feed\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://rowanmanning.com/weeknotes/\">Rowan‚Äôs Weeknotes</a> (<a href=\"https://rowanmanning.com/weeknotes/feed.xml\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://indieweb.org/this-week\">This Week in the IndieWeb</a> (<a href=\"https://indieweb.org/this-week/feed.xml\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://thehistoryoftheweb.com\">The History of the Web</a> (<a href=\"http://thehistoryoftheweb.com/feed/\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/\">Adactio: Journal</a> (<a href=\"http://adactio.com/journal/rss\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://warmedal.se/~bjorn/\">Atom feed</a> (<a href=\"https://warmedal.se/~bjorn/atom.xml\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://ohhelloana.blog\">Oh Hello Ana</a> (<a href=\"https://ohhelloana.blog/feed.xml\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://youtube.com/playlist?list=UUsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q\">Kurzgesagt ‚Äì In a Nutshell (uploads) on YouTube</a> (<a href=\"http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/base/users/Kurzgesagt/uploads?alt=rss&amp;v=2&amp;orderby=published&amp;client=ytapi-youtube-profile\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://technology.blog.gov.uk\">Technology in government</a> (<a href=\"https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/feed/atom/\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://www.steampunkcoffee.co.uk/blogs/steampunk-coffee-blog\">Steampunk Coffee Roasters - Steampunk Coffee Blog</a> (<a href=\"https://www.steampunkcoffee.co.uk/blogs/steampunk-coffee-blog.atom\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://matuzo.at\">Web development blog - Manuel Matuzoviƒá</a> (<a href=\"https://www.matuzo.at/feed.xml\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://islandinthenet.com\">Island in the Net</a> (<a href=\"http://islandinthenet.com/feed/\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://rowanmanning.com/posts/\">Rowan‚Äôs Blog</a> (<a href=\"https://rowanmanning.com/posts/feed.xml\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMb0O2CdPBNi-QqPk5T3gsQ\">James Hoffmann</a> (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCMb0O2CdPBNi-QqPk5T3gsQ\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://coffeesnobblog.com\">Coffee Snob Blog ¬ª Feed</a> (<a href=\"https://coffeesnobblog.com/feed/\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://jamesvandyne.com/feed/\">üèîTanzawa - Articles Feed</a> (<a href=\"https://jamesvandyne.com/articles/feed/\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"http://dieselsweeties.com\">Diesel Sweeties webcomic by rstevens</a> (<a href=\"http://www.dieselsweeties.com/ds-unifeed.xml\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://rubenerd.com/\">Rubenerd</a> (<a href=\"http://rubenerd.com/feed/\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://gds.blog.gov.uk\">Government Digital Service</a> (<a href=\"https://gds.blog.gov.uk/feed/\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://calumryan.com/\">Calum Ryan</a> (<a href=\"https://calumryan.com/feeds/atom\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://jkc.codes/\">John Kemp-Cruz</a> (<a href=\"https://jkc.codes/feed.atom\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://aaronparecki.com/\">Articles by Aaron Parecki</a> (<a href=\"https://aaronparecki.com/feed.xml\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://gilest.org\">gilest.org</a> (<a href=\"https://gilest.org/feed/\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"http://cweiske.de/feeds/cweiske.de\">cweiske.de news</a> (<a href=\"http://cweiske.de/feeds/news.xml\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://jamiesnotes.com\">Jamie‚Äôs Notes</a> (<a href=\"https://jamiesnotes.com/feed/\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3KGOt3IfrVxDNtz5o7H-5A\">European Coffee Trip</a> (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC3KGOt3IfrVxDNtz5o7H-5A\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog\">Jeremy Cherfas: Posts</a> (<a href=\"https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog.json\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://jamesg.blog/\">James‚Äô Coffee Blog</a> (<a href=\"https://jamesg.blog/feed.xml\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://petermolnar.net\">Latest entries from petermolnar.net</a> (<a href=\"https://petermolnar.net/feed/\">RSS feed</a>)</li>\n</ul><p>I do not read every post from these creators but I like staying up to date on new content from bloggers.
