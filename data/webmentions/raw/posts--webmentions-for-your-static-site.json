It‚Äôs only logical to store webmentions the same way, isn‚Äôt it?</p>\n<p>What pushed me was <a href=\"https://rowanmanning.com/posts/webmentions-for-your-static-site/\">the article about doing webmentions on a Hugo-based website</a>: why not make the server check webmention.io from time to time and save the new webmentions to a JSON, I could surely build on that. The idea of storing them in a separate file in <code>/data/</code> was immediately discarded: <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/\">Page Bundles</a> were invented so that we could store each post (<code>index.md</code>) together with the webmentions (<code>webmentions.json</code>) in the same subdirectory.

All I needed was to add an option to save to separate subdirectories, which I <a href=\"https://github.com/nekr0z/webmention.io-backup\">did</a>. I also added more options while I was at it (not sure if anyone needs those).<a href=\"https://evgenykuznetsov.org/en/posts/2021/old-comments/#fn:1\">1</a> Also, the code that does the saving to subdirectories will likely be reused later when I write a webmention endpoint.</p>\n<p>Here comes the first ‚Äúoops‚Äù: many of the site‚Äôs pages (including almost all the Reactions) are text-only, so I was too lazy to make Bundles for them.

Since I was going to store webmentions in Bundles, the first way of storing the pages doesn‚Äôt really work, and I have already accumulated enough pages stored in this manner.
