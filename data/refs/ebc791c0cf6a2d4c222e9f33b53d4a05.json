	"description": "This is a very brief note for my own benefit - if you are even slightly interested I recommend following the links to find other authors who have done a much better job of explaining this!   I had previously displayed WebMentions on posts via a script that ran on each pageview, queried webmention.io for mentions relevant to that page and rendered them - entirely based on the original approach documented by Sebastian de Dyne.",
